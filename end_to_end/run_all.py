# Managing the pipeline began to become a bit tedius so I wrote a wrapper function
# The wrapper function calls the scripts as requested and executes them
#
# Notes: I wouldn't mind rewriting this at some point as a list of files with a switch on/off

# Default scrapy bot updated to use the Crawler scraper
# Scrapes the website "AZlyrics for your selected artist
# I was able to successfully scrape all the lyrics for Real Friends before having my IP banned
# That will be my starting corpus 
#
# Notes:  Currently commented out because I have the data I need

# This process takes the core JSONLINES file generated by the scraper and puts it into
# A .CSV file that can be used to train a RNN.
# Each lyric line has its own row in the output dataset
# 
# Notes: The sequences/lines are not yet vectorized

# This process takes the core JSONLINES file generated by the scraper 
# This process tokenizes the words and prepares them for a TFIDF analysis
# The RNN is not dependent on this; this is used only for analysis & understanding
