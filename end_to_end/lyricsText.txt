I can never keep my mouth shut

But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out

I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back

Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...

White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.

There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.

If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
 

I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too

The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year

Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
 

I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back

I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year

Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on

I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
 

I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable

Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
 

I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk

So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side

Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over

Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable

Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar

I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back

Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah

Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar

So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed

Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go

I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night

I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real

One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah

I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want

We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side

Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable

Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk

I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away

I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out

You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through

And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
 

I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk

So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year

If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed

Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable

But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back

White knuckles and sleepy eyes

It helps to think I'm not alone.
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away

Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt

But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now

I hate to say I told you so

You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)

My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)

Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go

Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation

I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk

Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states.

I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out

But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
 

I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back

That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life

I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out

Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want
Knock me down
I'm not sure I have it in me to get back up
To be who I am seems exhausting anyway
You have a lot in common with my conscience
You both erase my confidence
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Back and forth
Between some kind of vague attachment to yesterday
And never knowing what form of myself I'll get today (to get today)
I'll always be a faded sign in your eyes
No matter what the point of view (point of view)
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
I'm not here
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want to hear
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Would you notice I'm not here
 

I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah

And I'll be proud when I look back

This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable

But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want
Knock me down
I'm not sure I have it in me to get back up
To be who I am seems exhausting anyway
You have a lot in common with my conscience
You both erase my confidence
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Back and forth
Between some kind of vague attachment to yesterday
And never knowing what form of myself I'll get today (to get today)
I'll always be a faded sign in your eyes
No matter what the point of view (point of view)
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
I'm not here
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want to hear
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Would you notice I'm not here
Am I telling myself the truth?
I'm used to pretending to be strong and clueless
Am I doing this right by you?
I seem to be coming off as wrong and ruthless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I changing my mind again?
All this indecision makes me shift my focus
Is the tension my only friend?
Anxiety holds my hand when life gets hopeless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I telling myself the truth about my self-esteem
And how others place their worth in me?
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
(The eyes of someone else)
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
Yeah, I'll keep smiling on the surface
(Am I telling myself the truth?)
"Smiling On The Surface" is the 3rd song released from the album "Composure". It was premiered on June 18, 2018.
 

I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you

The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable

Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience

"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want
Knock me down
I'm not sure I have it in me to get back up
To be who I am seems exhausting anyway
You have a lot in common with my conscience
You both erase my confidence
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Back and forth
Between some kind of vague attachment to yesterday
And never knowing what form of myself I'll get today (to get today)
I'll always be a faded sign in your eyes
No matter what the point of view (point of view)
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
I'm not here
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want to hear
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Would you notice I'm not here
Am I telling myself the truth?
I'm used to pretending to be strong and clueless
Am I doing this right by you?
I seem to be coming off as wrong and ruthless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I changing my mind again?
All this indecision makes me shift my focus
Is the tension my only friend?
Anxiety holds my hand when life gets hopeless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I telling myself the truth about my self-esteem
And how others place their worth in me?
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
(The eyes of someone else)
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
Yeah, I'll keep smiling on the surface
(Am I telling myself the truth?)
"Smiling On The Surface" is the 3rd song released from the album "Composure". It was premiered on June 18, 2018.
Swallowing a feeling
Counting cracks across the ceiling
Never reached the depths of them before
Finding flaws in every format
I know but haven't shown that
I could pick myself up off the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Redefine rock bottom with these empty orange bottles
Never felt so paralysed before (never felt this paralysed)
We're all looking for some answers
With the hangman's broken lantern
Growing ever closer to the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Why do I, why do I, feel so damn cold?
Why am I, why am I, still so low?
Why should I, why should I, get up or get out?
Why should I?
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
 

I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm

(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure

But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt

Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone

Two corners, different ends

"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want
Knock me down
I'm not sure I have it in me to get back up
To be who I am seems exhausting anyway
You have a lot in common with my conscience
You both erase my confidence
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Back and forth
Between some kind of vague attachment to yesterday
And never knowing what form of myself I'll get today (to get today)
I'll always be a faded sign in your eyes
No matter what the point of view (point of view)
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
I'm not here
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want to hear
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Would you notice I'm not here
Am I telling myself the truth?
I'm used to pretending to be strong and clueless
Am I doing this right by you?
I seem to be coming off as wrong and ruthless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I changing my mind again?
All this indecision makes me shift my focus
Is the tension my only friend?
Anxiety holds my hand when life gets hopeless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I telling myself the truth about my self-esteem
And how others place their worth in me?
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
(The eyes of someone else)
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
Yeah, I'll keep smiling on the surface
(Am I telling myself the truth?)
"Smiling On The Surface" is the 3rd song released from the album "Composure". It was premiered on June 18, 2018.
Swallowing a feeling
Counting cracks across the ceiling
Never reached the depths of them before
Finding flaws in every format
I know but haven't shown that
I could pick myself up off the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Redefine rock bottom with these empty orange bottles
Never felt so paralysed before (never felt this paralysed)
We're all looking for some answers
With the hangman's broken lantern
Growing ever closer to the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Why do I, why do I, feel so damn cold?
Why am I, why am I, still so low?
Why should I, why should I, get up or get out?
Why should I?
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
Soft spoken, if ever out loud
These days not much gets out
My mind digs graves through the past
But never takes time to finish the act
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
No matter how cold it might get
My bed sheets are laced with regret
I try to fill in the lines
Rework the plans for a better design
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Here I am, bearing every burden
Here I am, showing every worry
To the world
To the world
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try
 

I can never keep my mouth shut

When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out

But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
White knuckles and sleepy eyes

There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away

"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want
Knock me down
I'm not sure I have it in me to get back up
To be who I am seems exhausting anyway
You have a lot in common with my conscience
You both erase my confidence
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Back and forth
Between some kind of vague attachment to yesterday
And never knowing what form of myself I'll get today (to get today)
I'll always be a faded sign in your eyes
No matter what the point of view (point of view)
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
I'm not here
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want to hear
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Would you notice I'm not here
Am I telling myself the truth?
I'm used to pretending to be strong and clueless
Am I doing this right by you?
I seem to be coming off as wrong and ruthless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I changing my mind again?
All this indecision makes me shift my focus
Is the tension my only friend?
Anxiety holds my hand when life gets hopeless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I telling myself the truth about my self-esteem
And how others place their worth in me?
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
(The eyes of someone else)
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
Yeah, I'll keep smiling on the surface
(Am I telling myself the truth?)
"Smiling On The Surface" is the 3rd song released from the album "Composure". It was premiered on June 18, 2018.
Swallowing a feeling
Counting cracks across the ceiling
Never reached the depths of them before
Finding flaws in every format
I know but haven't shown that
I could pick myself up off the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Redefine rock bottom with these empty orange bottles
Never felt so paralysed before (never felt this paralysed)
We're all looking for some answers
With the hangman's broken lantern
Growing ever closer to the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Why do I, why do I, feel so damn cold?
Why am I, why am I, still so low?
Why should I, why should I, get up or get out?
Why should I?
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
Soft spoken, if ever out loud
These days not much gets out
My mind digs graves through the past
But never takes time to finish the act
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
No matter how cold it might get
My bed sheets are laced with regret
I try to fill in the lines
Rework the plans for a better design
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Here I am, bearing every burden
Here I am, showing every worry
To the world
To the world
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try
I'm at best your second option
Like a key under the mat
Are my emotions hard to read?
Seems I'm good at hiding
Reality
You disregard the consequences
Always seem to shift the blame
You burn the bridge and then I build it
Seems you're good at hiding
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
You make me feel helpless
Like a bird with broken wings
Forcing me to be more selfless
Lean on me, don't knock me over
It seems we're good at hiding
It seems we're good at fighting
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
I'm all alone
I feel sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
I'm all alone
I'm feeling sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
(There's nothing I can do)
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
 

I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable

But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed

When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out

Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want
Knock me down
I'm not sure I have it in me to get back up
To be who I am seems exhausting anyway
You have a lot in common with my conscience
You both erase my confidence
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Back and forth
Between some kind of vague attachment to yesterday
And never knowing what form of myself I'll get today (to get today)
I'll always be a faded sign in your eyes
No matter what the point of view (point of view)
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
I'm not here
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want to hear
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Would you notice I'm not here
Am I telling myself the truth?
I'm used to pretending to be strong and clueless
Am I doing this right by you?
I seem to be coming off as wrong and ruthless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I changing my mind again?
All this indecision makes me shift my focus
Is the tension my only friend?
Anxiety holds my hand when life gets hopeless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I telling myself the truth about my self-esteem
And how others place their worth in me?
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
(The eyes of someone else)
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
Yeah, I'll keep smiling on the surface
(Am I telling myself the truth?)
"Smiling On The Surface" is the 3rd song released from the album "Composure". It was premiered on June 18, 2018.
Swallowing a feeling
Counting cracks across the ceiling
Never reached the depths of them before
Finding flaws in every format
I know but haven't shown that
I could pick myself up off the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Redefine rock bottom with these empty orange bottles
Never felt so paralysed before (never felt this paralysed)
We're all looking for some answers
With the hangman's broken lantern
Growing ever closer to the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Why do I, why do I, feel so damn cold?
Why am I, why am I, still so low?
Why should I, why should I, get up or get out?
Why should I?
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
Soft spoken, if ever out loud
These days not much gets out
My mind digs graves through the past
But never takes time to finish the act
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
No matter how cold it might get
My bed sheets are laced with regret
I try to fill in the lines
Rework the plans for a better design
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Here I am, bearing every burden
Here I am, showing every worry
To the world
To the world
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try
I'm at best your second option
Like a key under the mat
Are my emotions hard to read?
Seems I'm good at hiding
Reality
You disregard the consequences
Always seem to shift the blame
You burn the bridge and then I build it
Seems you're good at hiding
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
You make me feel helpless
Like a bird with broken wings
Forcing me to be more selfless
Lean on me, don't knock me over
It seems we're good at hiding
It seems we're good at fighting
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
I'm all alone
I feel sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
I'm all alone
I'm feeling sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
(There's nothing I can do)
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
Is there any chance you could cut me some slack?
Because I've been hanging for a while
From this withered rope
Forcing every sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
What could I ask that you help me hold back
Cause I've been falling for a while
Down this fucking slope
Losing any sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
There's a collage of photos framed
Dating '93 to '95
Though all it shows me is that
I'm just a bad seed
Falling off the family tree
 

I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better

There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want
Knock me down
I'm not sure I have it in me to get back up
To be who I am seems exhausting anyway
You have a lot in common with my conscience
You both erase my confidence
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Back and forth
Between some kind of vague attachment to yesterday
And never knowing what form of myself I'll get today (to get today)
I'll always be a faded sign in your eyes
No matter what the point of view (point of view)
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
I'm not here
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want to hear
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Would you notice I'm not here
Am I telling myself the truth?
I'm used to pretending to be strong and clueless
Am I doing this right by you?
I seem to be coming off as wrong and ruthless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I changing my mind again?
All this indecision makes me shift my focus
Is the tension my only friend?
Anxiety holds my hand when life gets hopeless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I telling myself the truth about my self-esteem
And how others place their worth in me?
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
(The eyes of someone else)
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
Yeah, I'll keep smiling on the surface
(Am I telling myself the truth?)
"Smiling On The Surface" is the 3rd song released from the album "Composure". It was premiered on June 18, 2018.
Swallowing a feeling
Counting cracks across the ceiling
Never reached the depths of them before
Finding flaws in every format
I know but haven't shown that
I could pick myself up off the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Redefine rock bottom with these empty orange bottles
Never felt so paralysed before (never felt this paralysed)
We're all looking for some answers
With the hangman's broken lantern
Growing ever closer to the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Why do I, why do I, feel so damn cold?
Why am I, why am I, still so low?
Why should I, why should I, get up or get out?
Why should I?
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
Soft spoken, if ever out loud
These days not much gets out
My mind digs graves through the past
But never takes time to finish the act
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
No matter how cold it might get
My bed sheets are laced with regret
I try to fill in the lines
Rework the plans for a better design
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Here I am, bearing every burden
Here I am, showing every worry
To the world
To the world
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try
I'm at best your second option
Like a key under the mat
Are my emotions hard to read?
Seems I'm good at hiding
Reality
You disregard the consequences
Always seem to shift the blame
You burn the bridge and then I build it
Seems you're good at hiding
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
You make me feel helpless
Like a bird with broken wings
Forcing me to be more selfless
Lean on me, don't knock me over
It seems we're good at hiding
It seems we're good at fighting
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
I'm all alone
I feel sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
I'm all alone
I'm feeling sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
(There's nothing I can do)
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
Is there any chance you could cut me some slack?
Because I've been hanging for a while
From this withered rope
Forcing every sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
What could I ask that you help me hold back
Cause I've been falling for a while
Down this fucking slope
Losing any sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
There's a collage of photos framed
Dating '93 to '95
Though all it shows me is that
I'm just a bad seed
Falling off the family tree
I've got more complaints
More than pleasantries to say
Every monument is idly arranged
Every figure that has ever held importance in my life
I find nobody is who I pictured them to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the faces in reflections of the past
I feel so close but I can't reach through the glass
My life burns out and flickers like the end of a cigarette
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the light in your eyes
Turn the blind eye (Turn the blind eye)
"Why are you hurting me" she screamed from her death bed
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
It's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
 

I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.

Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago.

I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.

I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is

I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)

Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on

"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want
Knock me down
I'm not sure I have it in me to get back up
To be who I am seems exhausting anyway
You have a lot in common with my conscience
You both erase my confidence
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Back and forth
Between some kind of vague attachment to yesterday
And never knowing what form of myself I'll get today (to get today)
I'll always be a faded sign in your eyes
No matter what the point of view (point of view)
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
I'm not here
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want to hear
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Would you notice I'm not here
Am I telling myself the truth?
I'm used to pretending to be strong and clueless
Am I doing this right by you?
I seem to be coming off as wrong and ruthless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I changing my mind again?
All this indecision makes me shift my focus
Is the tension my only friend?
Anxiety holds my hand when life gets hopeless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I telling myself the truth about my self-esteem
And how others place their worth in me?
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
(The eyes of someone else)
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
Yeah, I'll keep smiling on the surface
(Am I telling myself the truth?)
"Smiling On The Surface" is the 3rd song released from the album "Composure". It was premiered on June 18, 2018.
Swallowing a feeling
Counting cracks across the ceiling
Never reached the depths of them before
Finding flaws in every format
I know but haven't shown that
I could pick myself up off the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Redefine rock bottom with these empty orange bottles
Never felt so paralysed before (never felt this paralysed)
We're all looking for some answers
With the hangman's broken lantern
Growing ever closer to the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Why do I, why do I, feel so damn cold?
Why am I, why am I, still so low?
Why should I, why should I, get up or get out?
Why should I?
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
Soft spoken, if ever out loud
These days not much gets out
My mind digs graves through the past
But never takes time to finish the act
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
No matter how cold it might get
My bed sheets are laced with regret
I try to fill in the lines
Rework the plans for a better design
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Here I am, bearing every burden
Here I am, showing every worry
To the world
To the world
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try
I'm at best your second option
Like a key under the mat
Are my emotions hard to read?
Seems I'm good at hiding
Reality
You disregard the consequences
Always seem to shift the blame
You burn the bridge and then I build it
Seems you're good at hiding
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
You make me feel helpless
Like a bird with broken wings
Forcing me to be more selfless
Lean on me, don't knock me over
It seems we're good at hiding
It seems we're good at fighting
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
I'm all alone
I feel sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
I'm all alone
I'm feeling sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
(There's nothing I can do)
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
Is there any chance you could cut me some slack?
Because I've been hanging for a while
From this withered rope
Forcing every sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
What could I ask that you help me hold back
Cause I've been falling for a while
Down this fucking slope
Losing any sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
There's a collage of photos framed
Dating '93 to '95
Though all it shows me is that
I'm just a bad seed
Falling off the family tree
I've got more complaints
More than pleasantries to say
Every monument is idly arranged
Every figure that has ever held importance in my life
I find nobody is who I pictured them to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the faces in reflections of the past
I feel so close but I can't reach through the glass
My life burns out and flickers like the end of a cigarette
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the light in your eyes
Turn the blind eye (Turn the blind eye)
"Why are you hurting me" she screamed from her death bed
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
It's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
The tears run down your cheekbones
I feel sorry for you
But I'm too fucking selfish to say I do
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be different
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Today I ripped myself wide open
And I saw that my heart isn't as fucked as I recalled
It's still flawed and
It's sorely stitched to my old ways
I thought it was buried, but it's just stuck
To my old ways
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be something else
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Shaking in the driver's seat
Staring at the dashboard
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
Please just stay
Please just stay
You see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
To take a chance on me
To take a chance
 

I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out

Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm

But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want
Knock me down
I'm not sure I have it in me to get back up
To be who I am seems exhausting anyway
You have a lot in common with my conscience
You both erase my confidence
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Back and forth
Between some kind of vague attachment to yesterday
And never knowing what form of myself I'll get today (to get today)
I'll always be a faded sign in your eyes
No matter what the point of view (point of view)
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
I'm not here
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want to hear
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Would you notice I'm not here
Am I telling myself the truth?
I'm used to pretending to be strong and clueless
Am I doing this right by you?
I seem to be coming off as wrong and ruthless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I changing my mind again?
All this indecision makes me shift my focus
Is the tension my only friend?
Anxiety holds my hand when life gets hopeless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I telling myself the truth about my self-esteem
And how others place their worth in me?
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
(The eyes of someone else)
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
Yeah, I'll keep smiling on the surface
(Am I telling myself the truth?)
"Smiling On The Surface" is the 3rd song released from the album "Composure". It was premiered on June 18, 2018.
Swallowing a feeling
Counting cracks across the ceiling
Never reached the depths of them before
Finding flaws in every format
I know but haven't shown that
I could pick myself up off the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Redefine rock bottom with these empty orange bottles
Never felt so paralysed before (never felt this paralysed)
We're all looking for some answers
With the hangman's broken lantern
Growing ever closer to the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Why do I, why do I, feel so damn cold?
Why am I, why am I, still so low?
Why should I, why should I, get up or get out?
Why should I?
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
Soft spoken, if ever out loud
These days not much gets out
My mind digs graves through the past
But never takes time to finish the act
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
No matter how cold it might get
My bed sheets are laced with regret
I try to fill in the lines
Rework the plans for a better design
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Here I am, bearing every burden
Here I am, showing every worry
To the world
To the world
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try
I'm at best your second option
Like a key under the mat
Are my emotions hard to read?
Seems I'm good at hiding
Reality
You disregard the consequences
Always seem to shift the blame
You burn the bridge and then I build it
Seems you're good at hiding
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
You make me feel helpless
Like a bird with broken wings
Forcing me to be more selfless
Lean on me, don't knock me over
It seems we're good at hiding
It seems we're good at fighting
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
I'm all alone
I feel sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
I'm all alone
I'm feeling sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
(There's nothing I can do)
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
Is there any chance you could cut me some slack?
Because I've been hanging for a while
From this withered rope
Forcing every sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
What could I ask that you help me hold back
Cause I've been falling for a while
Down this fucking slope
Losing any sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
There's a collage of photos framed
Dating '93 to '95
Though all it shows me is that
I'm just a bad seed
Falling off the family tree
I've got more complaints
More than pleasantries to say
Every monument is idly arranged
Every figure that has ever held importance in my life
I find nobody is who I pictured them to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the faces in reflections of the past
I feel so close but I can't reach through the glass
My life burns out and flickers like the end of a cigarette
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the light in your eyes
Turn the blind eye (Turn the blind eye)
"Why are you hurting me" she screamed from her death bed
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
It's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
The tears run down your cheekbones
I feel sorry for you
But I'm too fucking selfish to say I do
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be different
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Today I ripped myself wide open
And I saw that my heart isn't as fucked as I recalled
It's still flawed and
It's sorely stitched to my old ways
I thought it was buried, but it's just stuck
To my old ways
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be something else
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Shaking in the driver's seat
Staring at the dashboard
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
Please just stay
Please just stay
You see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
To take a chance on me
To take a chance
I still see us sitting on that old couch
'Til the sun comes up
Listening to sad songs
We spent our time with smiles on our faces
I know it sounds selfish but I'll miss those days
I know it sounds selfish
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
The Fall leaves flying through the driveway
Keep triggering these memories of you
I'm torn apart with how our lives are changing
I'm sure it sounds selfish, I'm just being honest
I know it sounds selfish
But I'm trying to be honest
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
Let's go back to when thing weren't complicated
Let's go back to all those old dashboard songs
Let's go back to smoking on the side of my old house
We can never go back, we'll never go back
We'll never go back
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
I know it sounds selfish
I'm just being honest
 

I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go

I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want
Knock me down
I'm not sure I have it in me to get back up
To be who I am seems exhausting anyway
You have a lot in common with my conscience
You both erase my confidence
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Back and forth
Between some kind of vague attachment to yesterday
And never knowing what form of myself I'll get today (to get today)
I'll always be a faded sign in your eyes
No matter what the point of view (point of view)
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
I'm not here
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want to hear
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Would you notice I'm not here
Am I telling myself the truth?
I'm used to pretending to be strong and clueless
Am I doing this right by you?
I seem to be coming off as wrong and ruthless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I changing my mind again?
All this indecision makes me shift my focus
Is the tension my only friend?
Anxiety holds my hand when life gets hopeless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I telling myself the truth about my self-esteem
And how others place their worth in me?
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
(The eyes of someone else)
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
Yeah, I'll keep smiling on the surface
(Am I telling myself the truth?)
"Smiling On The Surface" is the 3rd song released from the album "Composure". It was premiered on June 18, 2018.
Swallowing a feeling
Counting cracks across the ceiling
Never reached the depths of them before
Finding flaws in every format
I know but haven't shown that
I could pick myself up off the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Redefine rock bottom with these empty orange bottles
Never felt so paralysed before (never felt this paralysed)
We're all looking for some answers
With the hangman's broken lantern
Growing ever closer to the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Why do I, why do I, feel so damn cold?
Why am I, why am I, still so low?
Why should I, why should I, get up or get out?
Why should I?
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
Soft spoken, if ever out loud
These days not much gets out
My mind digs graves through the past
But never takes time to finish the act
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
No matter how cold it might get
My bed sheets are laced with regret
I try to fill in the lines
Rework the plans for a better design
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Here I am, bearing every burden
Here I am, showing every worry
To the world
To the world
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try
I'm at best your second option
Like a key under the mat
Are my emotions hard to read?
Seems I'm good at hiding
Reality
You disregard the consequences
Always seem to shift the blame
You burn the bridge and then I build it
Seems you're good at hiding
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
You make me feel helpless
Like a bird with broken wings
Forcing me to be more selfless
Lean on me, don't knock me over
It seems we're good at hiding
It seems we're good at fighting
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
I'm all alone
I feel sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
I'm all alone
I'm feeling sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
(There's nothing I can do)
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
Is there any chance you could cut me some slack?
Because I've been hanging for a while
From this withered rope
Forcing every sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
What could I ask that you help me hold back
Cause I've been falling for a while
Down this fucking slope
Losing any sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
There's a collage of photos framed
Dating '93 to '95
Though all it shows me is that
I'm just a bad seed
Falling off the family tree
I've got more complaints
More than pleasantries to say
Every monument is idly arranged
Every figure that has ever held importance in my life
I find nobody is who I pictured them to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the faces in reflections of the past
I feel so close but I can't reach through the glass
My life burns out and flickers like the end of a cigarette
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the light in your eyes
Turn the blind eye (Turn the blind eye)
"Why are you hurting me" she screamed from her death bed
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
It's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
The tears run down your cheekbones
I feel sorry for you
But I'm too fucking selfish to say I do
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be different
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Today I ripped myself wide open
And I saw that my heart isn't as fucked as I recalled
It's still flawed and
It's sorely stitched to my old ways
I thought it was buried, but it's just stuck
To my old ways
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be something else
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Shaking in the driver's seat
Staring at the dashboard
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
Please just stay
Please just stay
You see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
To take a chance on me
To take a chance
I still see us sitting on that old couch
'Til the sun comes up
Listening to sad songs
We spent our time with smiles on our faces
I know it sounds selfish but I'll miss those days
I know it sounds selfish
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
The Fall leaves flying through the driveway
Keep triggering these memories of you
I'm torn apart with how our lives are changing
I'm sure it sounds selfish, I'm just being honest
I know it sounds selfish
But I'm trying to be honest
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
Let's go back to when thing weren't complicated
Let's go back to all those old dashboard songs
Let's go back to smoking on the side of my old house
We can never go back, we'll never go back
We'll never go back
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
I know it sounds selfish
I'm just being honest
I can't fix everything around me
I can't make everybody happy
And it'll be okay
Show me how to be something other than nostalgic
I want to feel inspired and innocent again
I just want to be worth your time
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Lately when I'm alone I keep thinking about the past
I'm trying to feel weak in my knees again
I want to stand up straight like when I graduated
I just want to be
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Do you remember when you saw right through my selfish skin?
Do you remember when I ignored everything you did?
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
It'll be okay
 

I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out

But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back

"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want
Knock me down
I'm not sure I have it in me to get back up
To be who I am seems exhausting anyway
You have a lot in common with my conscience
You both erase my confidence
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Back and forth
Between some kind of vague attachment to yesterday
And never knowing what form of myself I'll get today (to get today)
I'll always be a faded sign in your eyes
No matter what the point of view (point of view)
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
I'm not here
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want to hear
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Would you notice I'm not here
Am I telling myself the truth?
I'm used to pretending to be strong and clueless
Am I doing this right by you?
I seem to be coming off as wrong and ruthless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I changing my mind again?
All this indecision makes me shift my focus
Is the tension my only friend?
Anxiety holds my hand when life gets hopeless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I telling myself the truth about my self-esteem
And how others place their worth in me?
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
(The eyes of someone else)
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
Yeah, I'll keep smiling on the surface
(Am I telling myself the truth?)
"Smiling On The Surface" is the 3rd song released from the album "Composure". It was premiered on June 18, 2018.
Swallowing a feeling
Counting cracks across the ceiling
Never reached the depths of them before
Finding flaws in every format
I know but haven't shown that
I could pick myself up off the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Redefine rock bottom with these empty orange bottles
Never felt so paralysed before (never felt this paralysed)
We're all looking for some answers
With the hangman's broken lantern
Growing ever closer to the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Why do I, why do I, feel so damn cold?
Why am I, why am I, still so low?
Why should I, why should I, get up or get out?
Why should I?
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
Soft spoken, if ever out loud
These days not much gets out
My mind digs graves through the past
But never takes time to finish the act
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
No matter how cold it might get
My bed sheets are laced with regret
I try to fill in the lines
Rework the plans for a better design
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Here I am, bearing every burden
Here I am, showing every worry
To the world
To the world
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try
I'm at best your second option
Like a key under the mat
Are my emotions hard to read?
Seems I'm good at hiding
Reality
You disregard the consequences
Always seem to shift the blame
You burn the bridge and then I build it
Seems you're good at hiding
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
You make me feel helpless
Like a bird with broken wings
Forcing me to be more selfless
Lean on me, don't knock me over
It seems we're good at hiding
It seems we're good at fighting
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
I'm all alone
I feel sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
I'm all alone
I'm feeling sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
(There's nothing I can do)
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
Is there any chance you could cut me some slack?
Because I've been hanging for a while
From this withered rope
Forcing every sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
What could I ask that you help me hold back
Cause I've been falling for a while
Down this fucking slope
Losing any sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
There's a collage of photos framed
Dating '93 to '95
Though all it shows me is that
I'm just a bad seed
Falling off the family tree
I've got more complaints
More than pleasantries to say
Every monument is idly arranged
Every figure that has ever held importance in my life
I find nobody is who I pictured them to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the faces in reflections of the past
I feel so close but I can't reach through the glass
My life burns out and flickers like the end of a cigarette
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the light in your eyes
Turn the blind eye (Turn the blind eye)
"Why are you hurting me" she screamed from her death bed
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
It's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
The tears run down your cheekbones
I feel sorry for you
But I'm too fucking selfish to say I do
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be different
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Today I ripped myself wide open
And I saw that my heart isn't as fucked as I recalled
It's still flawed and
It's sorely stitched to my old ways
I thought it was buried, but it's just stuck
To my old ways
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be something else
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Shaking in the driver's seat
Staring at the dashboard
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
Please just stay
Please just stay
You see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
To take a chance on me
To take a chance
I still see us sitting on that old couch
'Til the sun comes up
Listening to sad songs
We spent our time with smiles on our faces
I know it sounds selfish but I'll miss those days
I know it sounds selfish
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
The Fall leaves flying through the driveway
Keep triggering these memories of you
I'm torn apart with how our lives are changing
I'm sure it sounds selfish, I'm just being honest
I know it sounds selfish
But I'm trying to be honest
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
Let's go back to when thing weren't complicated
Let's go back to all those old dashboard songs
Let's go back to smoking on the side of my old house
We can never go back, we'll never go back
We'll never go back
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
I know it sounds selfish
I'm just being honest
I can't fix everything around me
I can't make everybody happy
And it'll be okay
Show me how to be something other than nostalgic
I want to feel inspired and innocent again
I just want to be worth your time
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Lately when I'm alone I keep thinking about the past
I'm trying to feel weak in my knees again
I want to stand up straight like when I graduated
I just want to be
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Do you remember when you saw right through my selfish skin?
Do you remember when I ignored everything you did?
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
It'll be okay
We rush through our lives
Just to feel some kind of pride
Dismissing actualities is making matters worse
The ink will fade, but won't go away
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
I live in the middle of a lake
And I don't know how to swim
I've isolated everything
Everywhere I go I am consistently alone
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
Cautions only ever made me worry
You know that cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
 

I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway

There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want
Knock me down
I'm not sure I have it in me to get back up
To be who I am seems exhausting anyway
You have a lot in common with my conscience
You both erase my confidence
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Back and forth
Between some kind of vague attachment to yesterday
And never knowing what form of myself I'll get today (to get today)
I'll always be a faded sign in your eyes
No matter what the point of view (point of view)
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
I'm not here
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want to hear
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Would you notice I'm not here
Am I telling myself the truth?
I'm used to pretending to be strong and clueless
Am I doing this right by you?
I seem to be coming off as wrong and ruthless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I changing my mind again?
All this indecision makes me shift my focus
Is the tension my only friend?
Anxiety holds my hand when life gets hopeless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I telling myself the truth about my self-esteem
And how others place their worth in me?
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
(The eyes of someone else)
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
Yeah, I'll keep smiling on the surface
(Am I telling myself the truth?)
"Smiling On The Surface" is the 3rd song released from the album "Composure". It was premiered on June 18, 2018.
Swallowing a feeling
Counting cracks across the ceiling
Never reached the depths of them before
Finding flaws in every format
I know but haven't shown that
I could pick myself up off the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Redefine rock bottom with these empty orange bottles
Never felt so paralysed before (never felt this paralysed)
We're all looking for some answers
With the hangman's broken lantern
Growing ever closer to the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Why do I, why do I, feel so damn cold?
Why am I, why am I, still so low?
Why should I, why should I, get up or get out?
Why should I?
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
Soft spoken, if ever out loud
These days not much gets out
My mind digs graves through the past
But never takes time to finish the act
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
No matter how cold it might get
My bed sheets are laced with regret
I try to fill in the lines
Rework the plans for a better design
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Here I am, bearing every burden
Here I am, showing every worry
To the world
To the world
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try
I'm at best your second option
Like a key under the mat
Are my emotions hard to read?
Seems I'm good at hiding
Reality
You disregard the consequences
Always seem to shift the blame
You burn the bridge and then I build it
Seems you're good at hiding
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
You make me feel helpless
Like a bird with broken wings
Forcing me to be more selfless
Lean on me, don't knock me over
It seems we're good at hiding
It seems we're good at fighting
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
I'm all alone
I feel sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
I'm all alone
I'm feeling sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
(There's nothing I can do)
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
Is there any chance you could cut me some slack?
Because I've been hanging for a while
From this withered rope
Forcing every sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
What could I ask that you help me hold back
Cause I've been falling for a while
Down this fucking slope
Losing any sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
There's a collage of photos framed
Dating '93 to '95
Though all it shows me is that
I'm just a bad seed
Falling off the family tree
I've got more complaints
More than pleasantries to say
Every monument is idly arranged
Every figure that has ever held importance in my life
I find nobody is who I pictured them to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the faces in reflections of the past
I feel so close but I can't reach through the glass
My life burns out and flickers like the end of a cigarette
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the light in your eyes
Turn the blind eye (Turn the blind eye)
"Why are you hurting me" she screamed from her death bed
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
It's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
The tears run down your cheekbones
I feel sorry for you
But I'm too fucking selfish to say I do
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be different
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Today I ripped myself wide open
And I saw that my heart isn't as fucked as I recalled
It's still flawed and
It's sorely stitched to my old ways
I thought it was buried, but it's just stuck
To my old ways
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be something else
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Shaking in the driver's seat
Staring at the dashboard
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
Please just stay
Please just stay
You see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
To take a chance on me
To take a chance
I still see us sitting on that old couch
'Til the sun comes up
Listening to sad songs
We spent our time with smiles on our faces
I know it sounds selfish but I'll miss those days
I know it sounds selfish
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
The Fall leaves flying through the driveway
Keep triggering these memories of you
I'm torn apart with how our lives are changing
I'm sure it sounds selfish, I'm just being honest
I know it sounds selfish
But I'm trying to be honest
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
Let's go back to when thing weren't complicated
Let's go back to all those old dashboard songs
Let's go back to smoking on the side of my old house
We can never go back, we'll never go back
We'll never go back
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
I know it sounds selfish
I'm just being honest
I can't fix everything around me
I can't make everybody happy
And it'll be okay
Show me how to be something other than nostalgic
I want to feel inspired and innocent again
I just want to be worth your time
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Lately when I'm alone I keep thinking about the past
I'm trying to feel weak in my knees again
I want to stand up straight like when I graduated
I just want to be
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Do you remember when you saw right through my selfish skin?
Do you remember when I ignored everything you did?
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
It'll be okay
We rush through our lives
Just to feel some kind of pride
Dismissing actualities is making matters worse
The ink will fade, but won't go away
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
I live in the middle of a lake
And I don't know how to swim
I've isolated everything
Everywhere I go I am consistently alone
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
Cautions only ever made me worry
You know that cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
The patience I once had is running away with my youth
Away in its hands
I've been neglecting who I am
That's just who I was back then
Don't need to be perfect, just happy
I'm still a lost boy
I'm still a lost boy
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
Every once in a while I listen to Death Cab and think about how it used to be 
We thought that we knew the answers
When no one was asking
Asking the questions 
I'm still a lost boy 
I'm still a lost boy 
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
It feels like I've been taking the long way for a while now
Haven't been at home in more years than I care to say
I keep letting my past cover what the present shouldn't be
What I shouldn't be
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
 

I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out

But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back

"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want
Knock me down
I'm not sure I have it in me to get back up
To be who I am seems exhausting anyway
You have a lot in common with my conscience
You both erase my confidence
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Back and forth
Between some kind of vague attachment to yesterday
And never knowing what form of myself I'll get today (to get today)
I'll always be a faded sign in your eyes
No matter what the point of view (point of view)
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
I'm not here
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want to hear
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Would you notice I'm not here
Am I telling myself the truth?
I'm used to pretending to be strong and clueless
Am I doing this right by you?
I seem to be coming off as wrong and ruthless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I changing my mind again?
All this indecision makes me shift my focus
Is the tension my only friend?
Anxiety holds my hand when life gets hopeless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I telling myself the truth about my self-esteem
And how others place their worth in me?
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
(The eyes of someone else)
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
Yeah, I'll keep smiling on the surface
(Am I telling myself the truth?)
"Smiling On The Surface" is the 3rd song released from the album "Composure". It was premiered on June 18, 2018.
Swallowing a feeling
Counting cracks across the ceiling
Never reached the depths of them before
Finding flaws in every format
I know but haven't shown that
I could pick myself up off the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Redefine rock bottom with these empty orange bottles
Never felt so paralysed before (never felt this paralysed)
We're all looking for some answers
With the hangman's broken lantern
Growing ever closer to the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Why do I, why do I, feel so damn cold?
Why am I, why am I, still so low?
Why should I, why should I, get up or get out?
Why should I?
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
Soft spoken, if ever out loud
These days not much gets out
My mind digs graves through the past
But never takes time to finish the act
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
No matter how cold it might get
My bed sheets are laced with regret
I try to fill in the lines
Rework the plans for a better design
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Here I am, bearing every burden
Here I am, showing every worry
To the world
To the world
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try
I'm at best your second option
Like a key under the mat
Are my emotions hard to read?
Seems I'm good at hiding
Reality
You disregard the consequences
Always seem to shift the blame
You burn the bridge and then I build it
Seems you're good at hiding
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
You make me feel helpless
Like a bird with broken wings
Forcing me to be more selfless
Lean on me, don't knock me over
It seems we're good at hiding
It seems we're good at fighting
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
I'm all alone
I feel sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
I'm all alone
I'm feeling sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
(There's nothing I can do)
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
Is there any chance you could cut me some slack?
Because I've been hanging for a while
From this withered rope
Forcing every sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
What could I ask that you help me hold back
Cause I've been falling for a while
Down this fucking slope
Losing any sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
There's a collage of photos framed
Dating '93 to '95
Though all it shows me is that
I'm just a bad seed
Falling off the family tree
I've got more complaints
More than pleasantries to say
Every monument is idly arranged
Every figure that has ever held importance in my life
I find nobody is who I pictured them to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the faces in reflections of the past
I feel so close but I can't reach through the glass
My life burns out and flickers like the end of a cigarette
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the light in your eyes
Turn the blind eye (Turn the blind eye)
"Why are you hurting me" she screamed from her death bed
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
It's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
The tears run down your cheekbones
I feel sorry for you
But I'm too fucking selfish to say I do
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be different
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Today I ripped myself wide open
And I saw that my heart isn't as fucked as I recalled
It's still flawed and
It's sorely stitched to my old ways
I thought it was buried, but it's just stuck
To my old ways
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be something else
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Shaking in the driver's seat
Staring at the dashboard
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
Please just stay
Please just stay
You see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
To take a chance on me
To take a chance
I still see us sitting on that old couch
'Til the sun comes up
Listening to sad songs
We spent our time with smiles on our faces
I know it sounds selfish but I'll miss those days
I know it sounds selfish
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
The Fall leaves flying through the driveway
Keep triggering these memories of you
I'm torn apart with how our lives are changing
I'm sure it sounds selfish, I'm just being honest
I know it sounds selfish
But I'm trying to be honest
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
Let's go back to when thing weren't complicated
Let's go back to all those old dashboard songs
Let's go back to smoking on the side of my old house
We can never go back, we'll never go back
We'll never go back
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
I know it sounds selfish
I'm just being honest
I can't fix everything around me
I can't make everybody happy
And it'll be okay
Show me how to be something other than nostalgic
I want to feel inspired and innocent again
I just want to be worth your time
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Lately when I'm alone I keep thinking about the past
I'm trying to feel weak in my knees again
I want to stand up straight like when I graduated
I just want to be
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Do you remember when you saw right through my selfish skin?
Do you remember when I ignored everything you did?
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
It'll be okay
We rush through our lives
Just to feel some kind of pride
Dismissing actualities is making matters worse
The ink will fade, but won't go away
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
I live in the middle of a lake
And I don't know how to swim
I've isolated everything
Everywhere I go I am consistently alone
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
Cautions only ever made me worry
You know that cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
The patience I once had is running away with my youth
Away in its hands
I've been neglecting who I am
That's just who I was back then
Don't need to be perfect, just happy
I'm still a lost boy
I'm still a lost boy
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
Every once in a while I listen to Death Cab and think about how it used to be 
We thought that we knew the answers
When no one was asking
Asking the questions 
I'm still a lost boy 
I'm still a lost boy 
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
It feels like I've been taking the long way for a while now
Haven't been at home in more years than I care to say
I keep letting my past cover what the present shouldn't be
What I shouldn't be
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
Staring out the window in my bedroom makes me think back
I see me as a boy out there
Lying in the grass
Singing songs with all the wrong notes
And graduating high school as my mom cries
I'm writing the same song over and over again
And feeling lost
I've always felt so lost
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I clenched the wheel the whole way home from Cleveland
With nothing more than my eyes half way open
And my hand smelling like smoke
Each mile I drive gets me closer to the streets that made me feel alone
I'm out of place and it doesn't feel wrong
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
 

I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want
Knock me down
I'm not sure I have it in me to get back up
To be who I am seems exhausting anyway
You have a lot in common with my conscience
You both erase my confidence
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Back and forth
Between some kind of vague attachment to yesterday
And never knowing what form of myself I'll get today (to get today)
I'll always be a faded sign in your eyes
No matter what the point of view (point of view)
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
I'm not here
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want to hear
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Would you notice I'm not here
Am I telling myself the truth?
I'm used to pretending to be strong and clueless
Am I doing this right by you?
I seem to be coming off as wrong and ruthless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I changing my mind again?
All this indecision makes me shift my focus
Is the tension my only friend?
Anxiety holds my hand when life gets hopeless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I telling myself the truth about my self-esteem
And how others place their worth in me?
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
(The eyes of someone else)
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
Yeah, I'll keep smiling on the surface
(Am I telling myself the truth?)
"Smiling On The Surface" is the 3rd song released from the album "Composure". It was premiered on June 18, 2018.
Swallowing a feeling
Counting cracks across the ceiling
Never reached the depths of them before
Finding flaws in every format
I know but haven't shown that
I could pick myself up off the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Redefine rock bottom with these empty orange bottles
Never felt so paralysed before (never felt this paralysed)
We're all looking for some answers
With the hangman's broken lantern
Growing ever closer to the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Why do I, why do I, feel so damn cold?
Why am I, why am I, still so low?
Why should I, why should I, get up or get out?
Why should I?
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
Soft spoken, if ever out loud
These days not much gets out
My mind digs graves through the past
But never takes time to finish the act
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
No matter how cold it might get
My bed sheets are laced with regret
I try to fill in the lines
Rework the plans for a better design
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Here I am, bearing every burden
Here I am, showing every worry
To the world
To the world
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try
I'm at best your second option
Like a key under the mat
Are my emotions hard to read?
Seems I'm good at hiding
Reality
You disregard the consequences
Always seem to shift the blame
You burn the bridge and then I build it
Seems you're good at hiding
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
You make me feel helpless
Like a bird with broken wings
Forcing me to be more selfless
Lean on me, don't knock me over
It seems we're good at hiding
It seems we're good at fighting
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
I'm all alone
I feel sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
I'm all alone
I'm feeling sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
(There's nothing I can do)
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
Is there any chance you could cut me some slack?
Because I've been hanging for a while
From this withered rope
Forcing every sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
What could I ask that you help me hold back
Cause I've been falling for a while
Down this fucking slope
Losing any sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
There's a collage of photos framed
Dating '93 to '95
Though all it shows me is that
I'm just a bad seed
Falling off the family tree
I've got more complaints
More than pleasantries to say
Every monument is idly arranged
Every figure that has ever held importance in my life
I find nobody is who I pictured them to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the faces in reflections of the past
I feel so close but I can't reach through the glass
My life burns out and flickers like the end of a cigarette
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the light in your eyes
Turn the blind eye (Turn the blind eye)
"Why are you hurting me" she screamed from her death bed
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
It's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
The tears run down your cheekbones
I feel sorry for you
But I'm too fucking selfish to say I do
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be different
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Today I ripped myself wide open
And I saw that my heart isn't as fucked as I recalled
It's still flawed and
It's sorely stitched to my old ways
I thought it was buried, but it's just stuck
To my old ways
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be something else
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Shaking in the driver's seat
Staring at the dashboard
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
Please just stay
Please just stay
You see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
To take a chance on me
To take a chance
I still see us sitting on that old couch
'Til the sun comes up
Listening to sad songs
We spent our time with smiles on our faces
I know it sounds selfish but I'll miss those days
I know it sounds selfish
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
The Fall leaves flying through the driveway
Keep triggering these memories of you
I'm torn apart with how our lives are changing
I'm sure it sounds selfish, I'm just being honest
I know it sounds selfish
But I'm trying to be honest
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
Let's go back to when thing weren't complicated
Let's go back to all those old dashboard songs
Let's go back to smoking on the side of my old house
We can never go back, we'll never go back
We'll never go back
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
I know it sounds selfish
I'm just being honest
I can't fix everything around me
I can't make everybody happy
And it'll be okay
Show me how to be something other than nostalgic
I want to feel inspired and innocent again
I just want to be worth your time
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Lately when I'm alone I keep thinking about the past
I'm trying to feel weak in my knees again
I want to stand up straight like when I graduated
I just want to be
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Do you remember when you saw right through my selfish skin?
Do you remember when I ignored everything you did?
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
It'll be okay
We rush through our lives
Just to feel some kind of pride
Dismissing actualities is making matters worse
The ink will fade, but won't go away
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
I live in the middle of a lake
And I don't know how to swim
I've isolated everything
Everywhere I go I am consistently alone
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
Cautions only ever made me worry
You know that cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
The patience I once had is running away with my youth
Away in its hands
I've been neglecting who I am
That's just who I was back then
Don't need to be perfect, just happy
I'm still a lost boy
I'm still a lost boy
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
Every once in a while I listen to Death Cab and think about how it used to be 
We thought that we knew the answers
When no one was asking
Asking the questions 
I'm still a lost boy 
I'm still a lost boy 
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
It feels like I've been taking the long way for a while now
Haven't been at home in more years than I care to say
I keep letting my past cover what the present shouldn't be
What I shouldn't be
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
Staring out the window in my bedroom makes me think back
I see me as a boy out there
Lying in the grass
Singing songs with all the wrong notes
And graduating high school as my mom cries
I'm writing the same song over and over again
And feeling lost
I've always felt so lost
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I clenched the wheel the whole way home from Cleveland
With nothing more than my eyes half way open
And my hand smelling like smoke
Each mile I drive gets me closer to the streets that made me feel alone
I'm out of place and it doesn't feel wrong
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I care too much
While you don't even care at all
It's just sad that you don't even care
I walk up the stairs to your apartment and I feel small
The lowest feelings and even lower standards
Pictures of simple times are on the top shelf
You lie to me and say you're happy with the way things are
With the way things are
It's just sad, oh it's sad that you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I spent so much damn time trying to move forward
It hurts me to watch you falling backwards
Brave your life
Finding solutions, not making excuses
Find solutions and stop waiting for excuses
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I care too much, while you don't even care at all
A bit much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different
Don't settle because you're scared
You know I pictured things to be different
I pictured things to be different for you
For you
 

I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm

You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want
Knock me down
I'm not sure I have it in me to get back up
To be who I am seems exhausting anyway
You have a lot in common with my conscience
You both erase my confidence
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Back and forth
Between some kind of vague attachment to yesterday
And never knowing what form of myself I'll get today (to get today)
I'll always be a faded sign in your eyes
No matter what the point of view (point of view)
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
I'm not here
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want to hear
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Would you notice I'm not here
Am I telling myself the truth?
I'm used to pretending to be strong and clueless
Am I doing this right by you?
I seem to be coming off as wrong and ruthless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I changing my mind again?
All this indecision makes me shift my focus
Is the tension my only friend?
Anxiety holds my hand when life gets hopeless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I telling myself the truth about my self-esteem
And how others place their worth in me?
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
(The eyes of someone else)
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
Yeah, I'll keep smiling on the surface
(Am I telling myself the truth?)
"Smiling On The Surface" is the 3rd song released from the album "Composure". It was premiered on June 18, 2018.
Swallowing a feeling
Counting cracks across the ceiling
Never reached the depths of them before
Finding flaws in every format
I know but haven't shown that
I could pick myself up off the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Redefine rock bottom with these empty orange bottles
Never felt so paralysed before (never felt this paralysed)
We're all looking for some answers
With the hangman's broken lantern
Growing ever closer to the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Why do I, why do I, feel so damn cold?
Why am I, why am I, still so low?
Why should I, why should I, get up or get out?
Why should I?
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
Soft spoken, if ever out loud
These days not much gets out
My mind digs graves through the past
But never takes time to finish the act
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
No matter how cold it might get
My bed sheets are laced with regret
I try to fill in the lines
Rework the plans for a better design
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Here I am, bearing every burden
Here I am, showing every worry
To the world
To the world
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try
I'm at best your second option
Like a key under the mat
Are my emotions hard to read?
Seems I'm good at hiding
Reality
You disregard the consequences
Always seem to shift the blame
You burn the bridge and then I build it
Seems you're good at hiding
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
You make me feel helpless
Like a bird with broken wings
Forcing me to be more selfless
Lean on me, don't knock me over
It seems we're good at hiding
It seems we're good at fighting
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
I'm all alone
I feel sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
I'm all alone
I'm feeling sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
(There's nothing I can do)
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
Is there any chance you could cut me some slack?
Because I've been hanging for a while
From this withered rope
Forcing every sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
What could I ask that you help me hold back
Cause I've been falling for a while
Down this fucking slope
Losing any sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
There's a collage of photos framed
Dating '93 to '95
Though all it shows me is that
I'm just a bad seed
Falling off the family tree
I've got more complaints
More than pleasantries to say
Every monument is idly arranged
Every figure that has ever held importance in my life
I find nobody is who I pictured them to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the faces in reflections of the past
I feel so close but I can't reach through the glass
My life burns out and flickers like the end of a cigarette
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the light in your eyes
Turn the blind eye (Turn the blind eye)
"Why are you hurting me" she screamed from her death bed
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
It's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
The tears run down your cheekbones
I feel sorry for you
But I'm too fucking selfish to say I do
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be different
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Today I ripped myself wide open
And I saw that my heart isn't as fucked as I recalled
It's still flawed and
It's sorely stitched to my old ways
I thought it was buried, but it's just stuck
To my old ways
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be something else
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Shaking in the driver's seat
Staring at the dashboard
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
Please just stay
Please just stay
You see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
To take a chance on me
To take a chance
I still see us sitting on that old couch
'Til the sun comes up
Listening to sad songs
We spent our time with smiles on our faces
I know it sounds selfish but I'll miss those days
I know it sounds selfish
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
The Fall leaves flying through the driveway
Keep triggering these memories of you
I'm torn apart with how our lives are changing
I'm sure it sounds selfish, I'm just being honest
I know it sounds selfish
But I'm trying to be honest
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
Let's go back to when thing weren't complicated
Let's go back to all those old dashboard songs
Let's go back to smoking on the side of my old house
We can never go back, we'll never go back
We'll never go back
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
I know it sounds selfish
I'm just being honest
I can't fix everything around me
I can't make everybody happy
And it'll be okay
Show me how to be something other than nostalgic
I want to feel inspired and innocent again
I just want to be worth your time
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Lately when I'm alone I keep thinking about the past
I'm trying to feel weak in my knees again
I want to stand up straight like when I graduated
I just want to be
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Do you remember when you saw right through my selfish skin?
Do you remember when I ignored everything you did?
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
It'll be okay
We rush through our lives
Just to feel some kind of pride
Dismissing actualities is making matters worse
The ink will fade, but won't go away
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
I live in the middle of a lake
And I don't know how to swim
I've isolated everything
Everywhere I go I am consistently alone
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
Cautions only ever made me worry
You know that cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
The patience I once had is running away with my youth
Away in its hands
I've been neglecting who I am
That's just who I was back then
Don't need to be perfect, just happy
I'm still a lost boy
I'm still a lost boy
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
Every once in a while I listen to Death Cab and think about how it used to be 
We thought that we knew the answers
When no one was asking
Asking the questions 
I'm still a lost boy 
I'm still a lost boy 
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
It feels like I've been taking the long way for a while now
Haven't been at home in more years than I care to say
I keep letting my past cover what the present shouldn't be
What I shouldn't be
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
Staring out the window in my bedroom makes me think back
I see me as a boy out there
Lying in the grass
Singing songs with all the wrong notes
And graduating high school as my mom cries
I'm writing the same song over and over again
And feeling lost
I've always felt so lost
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I clenched the wheel the whole way home from Cleveland
With nothing more than my eyes half way open
And my hand smelling like smoke
Each mile I drive gets me closer to the streets that made me feel alone
I'm out of place and it doesn't feel wrong
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I care too much
While you don't even care at all
It's just sad that you don't even care
I walk up the stairs to your apartment and I feel small
The lowest feelings and even lower standards
Pictures of simple times are on the top shelf
You lie to me and say you're happy with the way things are
With the way things are
It's just sad, oh it's sad that you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I spent so much damn time trying to move forward
It hurts me to watch you falling backwards
Brave your life
Finding solutions, not making excuses
Find solutions and stop waiting for excuses
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I care too much, while you don't even care at all
A bit much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different
Don't settle because you're scared
You know I pictured things to be different
I pictured things to be different for you
For you
Could you stay here 'til I fall asleep?
We'll pretend that we could make each other feel complete
I'm looking for something that's not inside of you
Will you think of me when you drive home?
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
Last night I closed my eyes
And thought about someone that wasn't you
The weight of the world slipped off my shoulders
And weighed my back to the floor
It isn't where you want to be
I know this isn't where you want to be
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
You tell me I'm broken
As I stare out my window at the street lights
I walk outside and I sit in the shade at 3am
And I feel whole again
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
And I know we're disconnected
 

I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost

Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want

I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want

I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side

"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want
Knock me down
I'm not sure I have it in me to get back up
To be who I am seems exhausting anyway
You have a lot in common with my conscience
You both erase my confidence
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Back and forth
Between some kind of vague attachment to yesterday
And never knowing what form of myself I'll get today (to get today)
I'll always be a faded sign in your eyes
No matter what the point of view (point of view)
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
I'm not here
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want to hear
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Would you notice I'm not here
Am I telling myself the truth?
I'm used to pretending to be strong and clueless
Am I doing this right by you?
I seem to be coming off as wrong and ruthless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I changing my mind again?
All this indecision makes me shift my focus
Is the tension my only friend?
Anxiety holds my hand when life gets hopeless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I telling myself the truth about my self-esteem
And how others place their worth in me?
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
(The eyes of someone else)
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
Yeah, I'll keep smiling on the surface
(Am I telling myself the truth?)
"Smiling On The Surface" is the 3rd song released from the album "Composure". It was premiered on June 18, 2018.
Swallowing a feeling
Counting cracks across the ceiling
Never reached the depths of them before
Finding flaws in every format
I know but haven't shown that
I could pick myself up off the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Redefine rock bottom with these empty orange bottles
Never felt so paralysed before (never felt this paralysed)
We're all looking for some answers
With the hangman's broken lantern
Growing ever closer to the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Why do I, why do I, feel so damn cold?
Why am I, why am I, still so low?
Why should I, why should I, get up or get out?
Why should I?
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
Soft spoken, if ever out loud
These days not much gets out
My mind digs graves through the past
But never takes time to finish the act
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
No matter how cold it might get
My bed sheets are laced with regret
I try to fill in the lines
Rework the plans for a better design
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Here I am, bearing every burden
Here I am, showing every worry
To the world
To the world
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try
I'm at best your second option
Like a key under the mat
Are my emotions hard to read?
Seems I'm good at hiding
Reality
You disregard the consequences
Always seem to shift the blame
You burn the bridge and then I build it
Seems you're good at hiding
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
You make me feel helpless
Like a bird with broken wings
Forcing me to be more selfless
Lean on me, don't knock me over
It seems we're good at hiding
It seems we're good at fighting
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
I'm all alone
I feel sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
I'm all alone
I'm feeling sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
(There's nothing I can do)
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
Is there any chance you could cut me some slack?
Because I've been hanging for a while
From this withered rope
Forcing every sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
What could I ask that you help me hold back
Cause I've been falling for a while
Down this fucking slope
Losing any sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
There's a collage of photos framed
Dating '93 to '95
Though all it shows me is that
I'm just a bad seed
Falling off the family tree
I've got more complaints
More than pleasantries to say
Every monument is idly arranged
Every figure that has ever held importance in my life
I find nobody is who I pictured them to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the faces in reflections of the past
I feel so close but I can't reach through the glass
My life burns out and flickers like the end of a cigarette
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the light in your eyes
Turn the blind eye (Turn the blind eye)
"Why are you hurting me" she screamed from her death bed
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
It's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
The tears run down your cheekbones
I feel sorry for you
But I'm too fucking selfish to say I do
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be different
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Today I ripped myself wide open
And I saw that my heart isn't as fucked as I recalled
It's still flawed and
It's sorely stitched to my old ways
I thought it was buried, but it's just stuck
To my old ways
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be something else
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Shaking in the driver's seat
Staring at the dashboard
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
Please just stay
Please just stay
You see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
To take a chance on me
To take a chance
I still see us sitting on that old couch
'Til the sun comes up
Listening to sad songs
We spent our time with smiles on our faces
I know it sounds selfish but I'll miss those days
I know it sounds selfish
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
The Fall leaves flying through the driveway
Keep triggering these memories of you
I'm torn apart with how our lives are changing
I'm sure it sounds selfish, I'm just being honest
I know it sounds selfish
But I'm trying to be honest
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
Let's go back to when thing weren't complicated
Let's go back to all those old dashboard songs
Let's go back to smoking on the side of my old house
We can never go back, we'll never go back
We'll never go back
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
I know it sounds selfish
I'm just being honest
I can't fix everything around me
I can't make everybody happy
And it'll be okay
Show me how to be something other than nostalgic
I want to feel inspired and innocent again
I just want to be worth your time
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Lately when I'm alone I keep thinking about the past
I'm trying to feel weak in my knees again
I want to stand up straight like when I graduated
I just want to be
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Do you remember when you saw right through my selfish skin?
Do you remember when I ignored everything you did?
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
It'll be okay
We rush through our lives
Just to feel some kind of pride
Dismissing actualities is making matters worse
The ink will fade, but won't go away
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
I live in the middle of a lake
And I don't know how to swim
I've isolated everything
Everywhere I go I am consistently alone
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
Cautions only ever made me worry
You know that cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
The patience I once had is running away with my youth
Away in its hands
I've been neglecting who I am
That's just who I was back then
Don't need to be perfect, just happy
I'm still a lost boy
I'm still a lost boy
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
Every once in a while I listen to Death Cab and think about how it used to be 
We thought that we knew the answers
When no one was asking
Asking the questions 
I'm still a lost boy 
I'm still a lost boy 
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
It feels like I've been taking the long way for a while now
Haven't been at home in more years than I care to say
I keep letting my past cover what the present shouldn't be
What I shouldn't be
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
Staring out the window in my bedroom makes me think back
I see me as a boy out there
Lying in the grass
Singing songs with all the wrong notes
And graduating high school as my mom cries
I'm writing the same song over and over again
And feeling lost
I've always felt so lost
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I clenched the wheel the whole way home from Cleveland
With nothing more than my eyes half way open
And my hand smelling like smoke
Each mile I drive gets me closer to the streets that made me feel alone
I'm out of place and it doesn't feel wrong
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I care too much
While you don't even care at all
It's just sad that you don't even care
I walk up the stairs to your apartment and I feel small
The lowest feelings and even lower standards
Pictures of simple times are on the top shelf
You lie to me and say you're happy with the way things are
With the way things are
It's just sad, oh it's sad that you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I spent so much damn time trying to move forward
It hurts me to watch you falling backwards
Brave your life
Finding solutions, not making excuses
Find solutions and stop waiting for excuses
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I care too much, while you don't even care at all
A bit much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different
Don't settle because you're scared
You know I pictured things to be different
I pictured things to be different for you
For you
Could you stay here 'til I fall asleep?
We'll pretend that we could make each other feel complete
I'm looking for something that's not inside of you
Will you think of me when you drive home?
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
Last night I closed my eyes
And thought about someone that wasn't you
The weight of the world slipped off my shoulders
And weighed my back to the floor
It isn't where you want to be
I know this isn't where you want to be
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
You tell me I'm broken
As I stare out my window at the street lights
I walk outside and I sit in the shade at 3am
And I feel whole again
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
And I know we're disconnected
I'm getting pretty good at leaving, my patience isn't wearing thin
Autumn never ends in my head, no matter how far I've been
It feels like everybody is the branch and I'm the leaves
Falling from the top of every leafless tree
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
All I see is the past two years before I hit the ground
Time is moving slower on the way down (on the way down)
Save your time spent wondering what's going through my mind
Let me go before you see me following behind
I'll save you from myself
Just let me go
I'll save you from myself
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
I've learned that it's okay to be selfish
It keeps me from falling apart at the seams
Stuck is where I feel in place
A feeling I'll embrace
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
 

I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm

I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want
Knock me down
I'm not sure I have it in me to get back up
To be who I am seems exhausting anyway
You have a lot in common with my conscience
You both erase my confidence
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Back and forth
Between some kind of vague attachment to yesterday
And never knowing what form of myself I'll get today (to get today)
I'll always be a faded sign in your eyes
No matter what the point of view (point of view)
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
I'm not here
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want to hear
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Would you notice I'm not here
Am I telling myself the truth?
I'm used to pretending to be strong and clueless
Am I doing this right by you?
I seem to be coming off as wrong and ruthless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I changing my mind again?
All this indecision makes me shift my focus
Is the tension my only friend?
Anxiety holds my hand when life gets hopeless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I telling myself the truth about my self-esteem
And how others place their worth in me?
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
(The eyes of someone else)
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
Yeah, I'll keep smiling on the surface
(Am I telling myself the truth?)
"Smiling On The Surface" is the 3rd song released from the album "Composure". It was premiered on June 18, 2018.
Swallowing a feeling
Counting cracks across the ceiling
Never reached the depths of them before
Finding flaws in every format
I know but haven't shown that
I could pick myself up off the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Redefine rock bottom with these empty orange bottles
Never felt so paralysed before (never felt this paralysed)
We're all looking for some answers
With the hangman's broken lantern
Growing ever closer to the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Why do I, why do I, feel so damn cold?
Why am I, why am I, still so low?
Why should I, why should I, get up or get out?
Why should I?
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
Soft spoken, if ever out loud
These days not much gets out
My mind digs graves through the past
But never takes time to finish the act
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
No matter how cold it might get
My bed sheets are laced with regret
I try to fill in the lines
Rework the plans for a better design
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Here I am, bearing every burden
Here I am, showing every worry
To the world
To the world
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try
I'm at best your second option
Like a key under the mat
Are my emotions hard to read?
Seems I'm good at hiding
Reality
You disregard the consequences
Always seem to shift the blame
You burn the bridge and then I build it
Seems you're good at hiding
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
You make me feel helpless
Like a bird with broken wings
Forcing me to be more selfless
Lean on me, don't knock me over
It seems we're good at hiding
It seems we're good at fighting
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
I'm all alone
I feel sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
I'm all alone
I'm feeling sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
(There's nothing I can do)
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
Is there any chance you could cut me some slack?
Because I've been hanging for a while
From this withered rope
Forcing every sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
What could I ask that you help me hold back
Cause I've been falling for a while
Down this fucking slope
Losing any sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
There's a collage of photos framed
Dating '93 to '95
Though all it shows me is that
I'm just a bad seed
Falling off the family tree
I've got more complaints
More than pleasantries to say
Every monument is idly arranged
Every figure that has ever held importance in my life
I find nobody is who I pictured them to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the faces in reflections of the past
I feel so close but I can't reach through the glass
My life burns out and flickers like the end of a cigarette
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the light in your eyes
Turn the blind eye (Turn the blind eye)
"Why are you hurting me" she screamed from her death bed
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
It's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
The tears run down your cheekbones
I feel sorry for you
But I'm too fucking selfish to say I do
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be different
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Today I ripped myself wide open
And I saw that my heart isn't as fucked as I recalled
It's still flawed and
It's sorely stitched to my old ways
I thought it was buried, but it's just stuck
To my old ways
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be something else
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Shaking in the driver's seat
Staring at the dashboard
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
Please just stay
Please just stay
You see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
To take a chance on me
To take a chance
I still see us sitting on that old couch
'Til the sun comes up
Listening to sad songs
We spent our time with smiles on our faces
I know it sounds selfish but I'll miss those days
I know it sounds selfish
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
The Fall leaves flying through the driveway
Keep triggering these memories of you
I'm torn apart with how our lives are changing
I'm sure it sounds selfish, I'm just being honest
I know it sounds selfish
But I'm trying to be honest
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
Let's go back to when thing weren't complicated
Let's go back to all those old dashboard songs
Let's go back to smoking on the side of my old house
We can never go back, we'll never go back
We'll never go back
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
I know it sounds selfish
I'm just being honest
I can't fix everything around me
I can't make everybody happy
And it'll be okay
Show me how to be something other than nostalgic
I want to feel inspired and innocent again
I just want to be worth your time
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Lately when I'm alone I keep thinking about the past
I'm trying to feel weak in my knees again
I want to stand up straight like when I graduated
I just want to be
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Do you remember when you saw right through my selfish skin?
Do you remember when I ignored everything you did?
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
It'll be okay
We rush through our lives
Just to feel some kind of pride
Dismissing actualities is making matters worse
The ink will fade, but won't go away
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
I live in the middle of a lake
And I don't know how to swim
I've isolated everything
Everywhere I go I am consistently alone
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
Cautions only ever made me worry
You know that cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
The patience I once had is running away with my youth
Away in its hands
I've been neglecting who I am
That's just who I was back then
Don't need to be perfect, just happy
I'm still a lost boy
I'm still a lost boy
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
Every once in a while I listen to Death Cab and think about how it used to be 
We thought that we knew the answers
When no one was asking
Asking the questions 
I'm still a lost boy 
I'm still a lost boy 
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
It feels like I've been taking the long way for a while now
Haven't been at home in more years than I care to say
I keep letting my past cover what the present shouldn't be
What I shouldn't be
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
Staring out the window in my bedroom makes me think back
I see me as a boy out there
Lying in the grass
Singing songs with all the wrong notes
And graduating high school as my mom cries
I'm writing the same song over and over again
And feeling lost
I've always felt so lost
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I clenched the wheel the whole way home from Cleveland
With nothing more than my eyes half way open
And my hand smelling like smoke
Each mile I drive gets me closer to the streets that made me feel alone
I'm out of place and it doesn't feel wrong
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I care too much
While you don't even care at all
It's just sad that you don't even care
I walk up the stairs to your apartment and I feel small
The lowest feelings and even lower standards
Pictures of simple times are on the top shelf
You lie to me and say you're happy with the way things are
With the way things are
It's just sad, oh it's sad that you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I spent so much damn time trying to move forward
It hurts me to watch you falling backwards
Brave your life
Finding solutions, not making excuses
Find solutions and stop waiting for excuses
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I care too much, while you don't even care at all
A bit much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different
Don't settle because you're scared
You know I pictured things to be different
I pictured things to be different for you
For you
Could you stay here 'til I fall asleep?
We'll pretend that we could make each other feel complete
I'm looking for something that's not inside of you
Will you think of me when you drive home?
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
Last night I closed my eyes
And thought about someone that wasn't you
The weight of the world slipped off my shoulders
And weighed my back to the floor
It isn't where you want to be
I know this isn't where you want to be
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
You tell me I'm broken
As I stare out my window at the street lights
I walk outside and I sit in the shade at 3am
And I feel whole again
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
And I know we're disconnected
I'm getting pretty good at leaving, my patience isn't wearing thin
Autumn never ends in my head, no matter how far I've been
It feels like everybody is the branch and I'm the leaves
Falling from the top of every leafless tree
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
All I see is the past two years before I hit the ground
Time is moving slower on the way down (on the way down)
Save your time spent wondering what's going through my mind
Let me go before you see me following behind
I'll save you from myself
Just let me go
I'll save you from myself
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
I've learned that it's okay to be selfish
It keeps me from falling apart at the seams
Stuck is where I feel in place
A feeling I'll embrace
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
So much for bad luck
If I built a boat with apologies I've got
I'd have a sorry looking raft
It always rains
But it's nice to see
That someone else is sad
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
The coin's faced up
But I'm not feeling any better
A soap box made for every single fuck up
It's tough seeing where I am
Instead of where I'm from
My roots can get loose
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
Can you find your calling if nothing is calling for you?
I'm coughing up a lung trying to get rid of you
To get rid of you
To get rid of you
Can you find your calling
If nothing's calling for you?
For you?
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
 

I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed

Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want
Knock me down
I'm not sure I have it in me to get back up
To be who I am seems exhausting anyway
You have a lot in common with my conscience
You both erase my confidence
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Back and forth
Between some kind of vague attachment to yesterday
And never knowing what form of myself I'll get today (to get today)
I'll always be a faded sign in your eyes
No matter what the point of view (point of view)
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
I'm not here
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want to hear
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Would you notice I'm not here
Am I telling myself the truth?
I'm used to pretending to be strong and clueless
Am I doing this right by you?
I seem to be coming off as wrong and ruthless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I changing my mind again?
All this indecision makes me shift my focus
Is the tension my only friend?
Anxiety holds my hand when life gets hopeless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I telling myself the truth about my self-esteem
And how others place their worth in me?
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
(The eyes of someone else)
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
Yeah, I'll keep smiling on the surface
(Am I telling myself the truth?)
"Smiling On The Surface" is the 3rd song released from the album "Composure". It was premiered on June 18, 2018.
Swallowing a feeling
Counting cracks across the ceiling
Never reached the depths of them before
Finding flaws in every format
I know but haven't shown that
I could pick myself up off the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Redefine rock bottom with these empty orange bottles
Never felt so paralysed before (never felt this paralysed)
We're all looking for some answers
With the hangman's broken lantern
Growing ever closer to the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Why do I, why do I, feel so damn cold?
Why am I, why am I, still so low?
Why should I, why should I, get up or get out?
Why should I?
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
Soft spoken, if ever out loud
These days not much gets out
My mind digs graves through the past
But never takes time to finish the act
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
No matter how cold it might get
My bed sheets are laced with regret
I try to fill in the lines
Rework the plans for a better design
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Here I am, bearing every burden
Here I am, showing every worry
To the world
To the world
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try
I'm at best your second option
Like a key under the mat
Are my emotions hard to read?
Seems I'm good at hiding
Reality
You disregard the consequences
Always seem to shift the blame
You burn the bridge and then I build it
Seems you're good at hiding
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
You make me feel helpless
Like a bird with broken wings
Forcing me to be more selfless
Lean on me, don't knock me over
It seems we're good at hiding
It seems we're good at fighting
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
I'm all alone
I feel sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
I'm all alone
I'm feeling sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
(There's nothing I can do)
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
Is there any chance you could cut me some slack?
Because I've been hanging for a while
From this withered rope
Forcing every sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
What could I ask that you help me hold back
Cause I've been falling for a while
Down this fucking slope
Losing any sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
There's a collage of photos framed
Dating '93 to '95
Though all it shows me is that
I'm just a bad seed
Falling off the family tree
I've got more complaints
More than pleasantries to say
Every monument is idly arranged
Every figure that has ever held importance in my life
I find nobody is who I pictured them to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the faces in reflections of the past
I feel so close but I can't reach through the glass
My life burns out and flickers like the end of a cigarette
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the light in your eyes
Turn the blind eye (Turn the blind eye)
"Why are you hurting me" she screamed from her death bed
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
It's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
The tears run down your cheekbones
I feel sorry for you
But I'm too fucking selfish to say I do
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be different
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Today I ripped myself wide open
And I saw that my heart isn't as fucked as I recalled
It's still flawed and
It's sorely stitched to my old ways
I thought it was buried, but it's just stuck
To my old ways
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be something else
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Shaking in the driver's seat
Staring at the dashboard
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
Please just stay
Please just stay
You see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
To take a chance on me
To take a chance
I still see us sitting on that old couch
'Til the sun comes up
Listening to sad songs
We spent our time with smiles on our faces
I know it sounds selfish but I'll miss those days
I know it sounds selfish
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
The Fall leaves flying through the driveway
Keep triggering these memories of you
I'm torn apart with how our lives are changing
I'm sure it sounds selfish, I'm just being honest
I know it sounds selfish
But I'm trying to be honest
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
Let's go back to when thing weren't complicated
Let's go back to all those old dashboard songs
Let's go back to smoking on the side of my old house
We can never go back, we'll never go back
We'll never go back
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
I know it sounds selfish
I'm just being honest
I can't fix everything around me
I can't make everybody happy
And it'll be okay
Show me how to be something other than nostalgic
I want to feel inspired and innocent again
I just want to be worth your time
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Lately when I'm alone I keep thinking about the past
I'm trying to feel weak in my knees again
I want to stand up straight like when I graduated
I just want to be
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Do you remember when you saw right through my selfish skin?
Do you remember when I ignored everything you did?
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
It'll be okay
We rush through our lives
Just to feel some kind of pride
Dismissing actualities is making matters worse
The ink will fade, but won't go away
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
I live in the middle of a lake
And I don't know how to swim
I've isolated everything
Everywhere I go I am consistently alone
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
Cautions only ever made me worry
You know that cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
The patience I once had is running away with my youth
Away in its hands
I've been neglecting who I am
That's just who I was back then
Don't need to be perfect, just happy
I'm still a lost boy
I'm still a lost boy
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
Every once in a while I listen to Death Cab and think about how it used to be 
We thought that we knew the answers
When no one was asking
Asking the questions 
I'm still a lost boy 
I'm still a lost boy 
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
It feels like I've been taking the long way for a while now
Haven't been at home in more years than I care to say
I keep letting my past cover what the present shouldn't be
What I shouldn't be
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
Staring out the window in my bedroom makes me think back
I see me as a boy out there
Lying in the grass
Singing songs with all the wrong notes
And graduating high school as my mom cries
I'm writing the same song over and over again
And feeling lost
I've always felt so lost
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I clenched the wheel the whole way home from Cleveland
With nothing more than my eyes half way open
And my hand smelling like smoke
Each mile I drive gets me closer to the streets that made me feel alone
I'm out of place and it doesn't feel wrong
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I care too much
While you don't even care at all
It's just sad that you don't even care
I walk up the stairs to your apartment and I feel small
The lowest feelings and even lower standards
Pictures of simple times are on the top shelf
You lie to me and say you're happy with the way things are
With the way things are
It's just sad, oh it's sad that you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I spent so much damn time trying to move forward
It hurts me to watch you falling backwards
Brave your life
Finding solutions, not making excuses
Find solutions and stop waiting for excuses
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I care too much, while you don't even care at all
A bit much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different
Don't settle because you're scared
You know I pictured things to be different
I pictured things to be different for you
For you
Could you stay here 'til I fall asleep?
We'll pretend that we could make each other feel complete
I'm looking for something that's not inside of you
Will you think of me when you drive home?
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
Last night I closed my eyes
And thought about someone that wasn't you
The weight of the world slipped off my shoulders
And weighed my back to the floor
It isn't where you want to be
I know this isn't where you want to be
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
You tell me I'm broken
As I stare out my window at the street lights
I walk outside and I sit in the shade at 3am
And I feel whole again
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
And I know we're disconnected
I'm getting pretty good at leaving, my patience isn't wearing thin
Autumn never ends in my head, no matter how far I've been
It feels like everybody is the branch and I'm the leaves
Falling from the top of every leafless tree
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
All I see is the past two years before I hit the ground
Time is moving slower on the way down (on the way down)
Save your time spent wondering what's going through my mind
Let me go before you see me following behind
I'll save you from myself
Just let me go
I'll save you from myself
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
I've learned that it's okay to be selfish
It keeps me from falling apart at the seams
Stuck is where I feel in place
A feeling I'll embrace
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
So much for bad luck
If I built a boat with apologies I've got
I'd have a sorry looking raft
It always rains
But it's nice to see
That someone else is sad
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
The coin's faced up
But I'm not feeling any better
A soap box made for every single fuck up
It's tough seeing where I am
Instead of where I'm from
My roots can get loose
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
Can you find your calling if nothing is calling for you?
I'm coughing up a lung trying to get rid of you
To get rid of you
To get rid of you
Can you find your calling
If nothing's calling for you?
For you?
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
When I heard my parents cry
I realized that we're all lost kids
Trying to find our way home
Blood is thicker than water
And I still feel like everyone I love forgot how to swim
At least there are pictures of my sister and me
Hanging on the wall in my garage
They always give me peace of mind
They always give me peace of mind
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I'm starting to see that
We're always changing
It's just so weird to think that we're always changing
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
I never spent my youth thinking of half the shit I'd go through
Living in the past never helped me
Last night I drove past the house that I grew up in
And tried to find that happiness
Living in the past never helped me
Or anyone move forward
There's no love, no growth for me here
Anymore, anymore
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I know this place is the same and that I'm changing
And I'm just
 

I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out

Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real

"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want
Knock me down
I'm not sure I have it in me to get back up
To be who I am seems exhausting anyway
You have a lot in common with my conscience
You both erase my confidence
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Back and forth
Between some kind of vague attachment to yesterday
And never knowing what form of myself I'll get today (to get today)
I'll always be a faded sign in your eyes
No matter what the point of view (point of view)
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
I'm not here
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want to hear
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Would you notice I'm not here
Am I telling myself the truth?
I'm used to pretending to be strong and clueless
Am I doing this right by you?
I seem to be coming off as wrong and ruthless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I changing my mind again?
All this indecision makes me shift my focus
Is the tension my only friend?
Anxiety holds my hand when life gets hopeless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I telling myself the truth about my self-esteem
And how others place their worth in me?
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
(The eyes of someone else)
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
Yeah, I'll keep smiling on the surface
(Am I telling myself the truth?)
"Smiling On The Surface" is the 3rd song released from the album "Composure". It was premiered on June 18, 2018.
Swallowing a feeling
Counting cracks across the ceiling
Never reached the depths of them before
Finding flaws in every format
I know but haven't shown that
I could pick myself up off the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Redefine rock bottom with these empty orange bottles
Never felt so paralysed before (never felt this paralysed)
We're all looking for some answers
With the hangman's broken lantern
Growing ever closer to the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Why do I, why do I, feel so damn cold?
Why am I, why am I, still so low?
Why should I, why should I, get up or get out?
Why should I?
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
Soft spoken, if ever out loud
These days not much gets out
My mind digs graves through the past
But never takes time to finish the act
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
No matter how cold it might get
My bed sheets are laced with regret
I try to fill in the lines
Rework the plans for a better design
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Here I am, bearing every burden
Here I am, showing every worry
To the world
To the world
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try
I'm at best your second option
Like a key under the mat
Are my emotions hard to read?
Seems I'm good at hiding
Reality
You disregard the consequences
Always seem to shift the blame
You burn the bridge and then I build it
Seems you're good at hiding
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
You make me feel helpless
Like a bird with broken wings
Forcing me to be more selfless
Lean on me, don't knock me over
It seems we're good at hiding
It seems we're good at fighting
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
I'm all alone
I feel sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
I'm all alone
I'm feeling sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
(There's nothing I can do)
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
Is there any chance you could cut me some slack?
Because I've been hanging for a while
From this withered rope
Forcing every sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
What could I ask that you help me hold back
Cause I've been falling for a while
Down this fucking slope
Losing any sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
There's a collage of photos framed
Dating '93 to '95
Though all it shows me is that
I'm just a bad seed
Falling off the family tree
I've got more complaints
More than pleasantries to say
Every monument is idly arranged
Every figure that has ever held importance in my life
I find nobody is who I pictured them to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the faces in reflections of the past
I feel so close but I can't reach through the glass
My life burns out and flickers like the end of a cigarette
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the light in your eyes
Turn the blind eye (Turn the blind eye)
"Why are you hurting me" she screamed from her death bed
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
It's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
The tears run down your cheekbones
I feel sorry for you
But I'm too fucking selfish to say I do
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be different
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Today I ripped myself wide open
And I saw that my heart isn't as fucked as I recalled
It's still flawed and
It's sorely stitched to my old ways
I thought it was buried, but it's just stuck
To my old ways
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be something else
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Shaking in the driver's seat
Staring at the dashboard
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
Please just stay
Please just stay
You see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
To take a chance on me
To take a chance
I still see us sitting on that old couch
'Til the sun comes up
Listening to sad songs
We spent our time with smiles on our faces
I know it sounds selfish but I'll miss those days
I know it sounds selfish
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
The Fall leaves flying through the driveway
Keep triggering these memories of you
I'm torn apart with how our lives are changing
I'm sure it sounds selfish, I'm just being honest
I know it sounds selfish
But I'm trying to be honest
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
Let's go back to when thing weren't complicated
Let's go back to all those old dashboard songs
Let's go back to smoking on the side of my old house
We can never go back, we'll never go back
We'll never go back
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
I know it sounds selfish
I'm just being honest
I can't fix everything around me
I can't make everybody happy
And it'll be okay
Show me how to be something other than nostalgic
I want to feel inspired and innocent again
I just want to be worth your time
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Lately when I'm alone I keep thinking about the past
I'm trying to feel weak in my knees again
I want to stand up straight like when I graduated
I just want to be
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Do you remember when you saw right through my selfish skin?
Do you remember when I ignored everything you did?
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
It'll be okay
We rush through our lives
Just to feel some kind of pride
Dismissing actualities is making matters worse
The ink will fade, but won't go away
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
I live in the middle of a lake
And I don't know how to swim
I've isolated everything
Everywhere I go I am consistently alone
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
Cautions only ever made me worry
You know that cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
The patience I once had is running away with my youth
Away in its hands
I've been neglecting who I am
That's just who I was back then
Don't need to be perfect, just happy
I'm still a lost boy
I'm still a lost boy
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
Every once in a while I listen to Death Cab and think about how it used to be 
We thought that we knew the answers
When no one was asking
Asking the questions 
I'm still a lost boy 
I'm still a lost boy 
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
It feels like I've been taking the long way for a while now
Haven't been at home in more years than I care to say
I keep letting my past cover what the present shouldn't be
What I shouldn't be
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
Staring out the window in my bedroom makes me think back
I see me as a boy out there
Lying in the grass
Singing songs with all the wrong notes
And graduating high school as my mom cries
I'm writing the same song over and over again
And feeling lost
I've always felt so lost
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I clenched the wheel the whole way home from Cleveland
With nothing more than my eyes half way open
And my hand smelling like smoke
Each mile I drive gets me closer to the streets that made me feel alone
I'm out of place and it doesn't feel wrong
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I care too much
While you don't even care at all
It's just sad that you don't even care
I walk up the stairs to your apartment and I feel small
The lowest feelings and even lower standards
Pictures of simple times are on the top shelf
You lie to me and say you're happy with the way things are
With the way things are
It's just sad, oh it's sad that you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I spent so much damn time trying to move forward
It hurts me to watch you falling backwards
Brave your life
Finding solutions, not making excuses
Find solutions and stop waiting for excuses
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I care too much, while you don't even care at all
A bit much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different
Don't settle because you're scared
You know I pictured things to be different
I pictured things to be different for you
For you
Could you stay here 'til I fall asleep?
We'll pretend that we could make each other feel complete
I'm looking for something that's not inside of you
Will you think of me when you drive home?
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
Last night I closed my eyes
And thought about someone that wasn't you
The weight of the world slipped off my shoulders
And weighed my back to the floor
It isn't where you want to be
I know this isn't where you want to be
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
You tell me I'm broken
As I stare out my window at the street lights
I walk outside and I sit in the shade at 3am
And I feel whole again
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
And I know we're disconnected
I'm getting pretty good at leaving, my patience isn't wearing thin
Autumn never ends in my head, no matter how far I've been
It feels like everybody is the branch and I'm the leaves
Falling from the top of every leafless tree
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
All I see is the past two years before I hit the ground
Time is moving slower on the way down (on the way down)
Save your time spent wondering what's going through my mind
Let me go before you see me following behind
I'll save you from myself
Just let me go
I'll save you from myself
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
I've learned that it's okay to be selfish
It keeps me from falling apart at the seams
Stuck is where I feel in place
A feeling I'll embrace
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
So much for bad luck
If I built a boat with apologies I've got
I'd have a sorry looking raft
It always rains
But it's nice to see
That someone else is sad
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
The coin's faced up
But I'm not feeling any better
A soap box made for every single fuck up
It's tough seeing where I am
Instead of where I'm from
My roots can get loose
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
Can you find your calling if nothing is calling for you?
I'm coughing up a lung trying to get rid of you
To get rid of you
To get rid of you
Can you find your calling
If nothing's calling for you?
For you?
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
When I heard my parents cry
I realized that we're all lost kids
Trying to find our way home
Blood is thicker than water
And I still feel like everyone I love forgot how to swim
At least there are pictures of my sister and me
Hanging on the wall in my garage
They always give me peace of mind
They always give me peace of mind
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I'm starting to see that
We're always changing
It's just so weird to think that we're always changing
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
I never spent my youth thinking of half the shit I'd go through
Living in the past never helped me
Last night I drove past the house that I grew up in
And tried to find that happiness
Living in the past never helped me
Or anyone move forward
There's no love, no growth for me here
Anymore, anymore
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I know this place is the same and that I'm changing
And I'm just
When I get stopped by a train on my drive home
I don't let it get to me like the rest of the world
I smile and think about how much I've grown over this year
It gives me time to open my mind and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that train
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine without you
I've laid to rest the shit that was always out of my hands
I finally sent all my skeletons away
Like everything I couldn't fix and people I couldn't change
Konstantine always tore me apart and made me cry
Now I hear that song and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that...
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine
Happiness, won't get me over this
Happiness, won't get me over anything, over anything 
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
 

I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to

Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back

If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out

I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want

"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want
Knock me down
I'm not sure I have it in me to get back up
To be who I am seems exhausting anyway
You have a lot in common with my conscience
You both erase my confidence
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Back and forth
Between some kind of vague attachment to yesterday
And never knowing what form of myself I'll get today (to get today)
I'll always be a faded sign in your eyes
No matter what the point of view (point of view)
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
I'm not here
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want to hear
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Would you notice I'm not here
Am I telling myself the truth?
I'm used to pretending to be strong and clueless
Am I doing this right by you?
I seem to be coming off as wrong and ruthless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I changing my mind again?
All this indecision makes me shift my focus
Is the tension my only friend?
Anxiety holds my hand when life gets hopeless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I telling myself the truth about my self-esteem
And how others place their worth in me?
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
(The eyes of someone else)
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
Yeah, I'll keep smiling on the surface
(Am I telling myself the truth?)
"Smiling On The Surface" is the 3rd song released from the album "Composure". It was premiered on June 18, 2018.
Swallowing a feeling
Counting cracks across the ceiling
Never reached the depths of them before
Finding flaws in every format
I know but haven't shown that
I could pick myself up off the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Redefine rock bottom with these empty orange bottles
Never felt so paralysed before (never felt this paralysed)
We're all looking for some answers
With the hangman's broken lantern
Growing ever closer to the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Why do I, why do I, feel so damn cold?
Why am I, why am I, still so low?
Why should I, why should I, get up or get out?
Why should I?
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
Soft spoken, if ever out loud
These days not much gets out
My mind digs graves through the past
But never takes time to finish the act
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
No matter how cold it might get
My bed sheets are laced with regret
I try to fill in the lines
Rework the plans for a better design
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Here I am, bearing every burden
Here I am, showing every worry
To the world
To the world
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try
I'm at best your second option
Like a key under the mat
Are my emotions hard to read?
Seems I'm good at hiding
Reality
You disregard the consequences
Always seem to shift the blame
You burn the bridge and then I build it
Seems you're good at hiding
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
You make me feel helpless
Like a bird with broken wings
Forcing me to be more selfless
Lean on me, don't knock me over
It seems we're good at hiding
It seems we're good at fighting
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
I'm all alone
I feel sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
I'm all alone
I'm feeling sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
(There's nothing I can do)
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
Is there any chance you could cut me some slack?
Because I've been hanging for a while
From this withered rope
Forcing every sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
What could I ask that you help me hold back
Cause I've been falling for a while
Down this fucking slope
Losing any sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
There's a collage of photos framed
Dating '93 to '95
Though all it shows me is that
I'm just a bad seed
Falling off the family tree
I've got more complaints
More than pleasantries to say
Every monument is idly arranged
Every figure that has ever held importance in my life
I find nobody is who I pictured them to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the faces in reflections of the past
I feel so close but I can't reach through the glass
My life burns out and flickers like the end of a cigarette
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the light in your eyes
Turn the blind eye (Turn the blind eye)
"Why are you hurting me" she screamed from her death bed
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
It's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
The tears run down your cheekbones
I feel sorry for you
But I'm too fucking selfish to say I do
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be different
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Today I ripped myself wide open
And I saw that my heart isn't as fucked as I recalled
It's still flawed and
It's sorely stitched to my old ways
I thought it was buried, but it's just stuck
To my old ways
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be something else
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Shaking in the driver's seat
Staring at the dashboard
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
Please just stay
Please just stay
You see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
To take a chance on me
To take a chance
I still see us sitting on that old couch
'Til the sun comes up
Listening to sad songs
We spent our time with smiles on our faces
I know it sounds selfish but I'll miss those days
I know it sounds selfish
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
The Fall leaves flying through the driveway
Keep triggering these memories of you
I'm torn apart with how our lives are changing
I'm sure it sounds selfish, I'm just being honest
I know it sounds selfish
But I'm trying to be honest
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
Let's go back to when thing weren't complicated
Let's go back to all those old dashboard songs
Let's go back to smoking on the side of my old house
We can never go back, we'll never go back
We'll never go back
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
I know it sounds selfish
I'm just being honest
I can't fix everything around me
I can't make everybody happy
And it'll be okay
Show me how to be something other than nostalgic
I want to feel inspired and innocent again
I just want to be worth your time
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Lately when I'm alone I keep thinking about the past
I'm trying to feel weak in my knees again
I want to stand up straight like when I graduated
I just want to be
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Do you remember when you saw right through my selfish skin?
Do you remember when I ignored everything you did?
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
It'll be okay
We rush through our lives
Just to feel some kind of pride
Dismissing actualities is making matters worse
The ink will fade, but won't go away
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
I live in the middle of a lake
And I don't know how to swim
I've isolated everything
Everywhere I go I am consistently alone
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
Cautions only ever made me worry
You know that cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
The patience I once had is running away with my youth
Away in its hands
I've been neglecting who I am
That's just who I was back then
Don't need to be perfect, just happy
I'm still a lost boy
I'm still a lost boy
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
Every once in a while I listen to Death Cab and think about how it used to be 
We thought that we knew the answers
When no one was asking
Asking the questions 
I'm still a lost boy 
I'm still a lost boy 
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
It feels like I've been taking the long way for a while now
Haven't been at home in more years than I care to say
I keep letting my past cover what the present shouldn't be
What I shouldn't be
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
Staring out the window in my bedroom makes me think back
I see me as a boy out there
Lying in the grass
Singing songs with all the wrong notes
And graduating high school as my mom cries
I'm writing the same song over and over again
And feeling lost
I've always felt so lost
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I clenched the wheel the whole way home from Cleveland
With nothing more than my eyes half way open
And my hand smelling like smoke
Each mile I drive gets me closer to the streets that made me feel alone
I'm out of place and it doesn't feel wrong
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I care too much
While you don't even care at all
It's just sad that you don't even care
I walk up the stairs to your apartment and I feel small
The lowest feelings and even lower standards
Pictures of simple times are on the top shelf
You lie to me and say you're happy with the way things are
With the way things are
It's just sad, oh it's sad that you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I spent so much damn time trying to move forward
It hurts me to watch you falling backwards
Brave your life
Finding solutions, not making excuses
Find solutions and stop waiting for excuses
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I care too much, while you don't even care at all
A bit much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different
Don't settle because you're scared
You know I pictured things to be different
I pictured things to be different for you
For you
Could you stay here 'til I fall asleep?
We'll pretend that we could make each other feel complete
I'm looking for something that's not inside of you
Will you think of me when you drive home?
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
Last night I closed my eyes
And thought about someone that wasn't you
The weight of the world slipped off my shoulders
And weighed my back to the floor
It isn't where you want to be
I know this isn't where you want to be
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
You tell me I'm broken
As I stare out my window at the street lights
I walk outside and I sit in the shade at 3am
And I feel whole again
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
And I know we're disconnected
I'm getting pretty good at leaving, my patience isn't wearing thin
Autumn never ends in my head, no matter how far I've been
It feels like everybody is the branch and I'm the leaves
Falling from the top of every leafless tree
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
All I see is the past two years before I hit the ground
Time is moving slower on the way down (on the way down)
Save your time spent wondering what's going through my mind
Let me go before you see me following behind
I'll save you from myself
Just let me go
I'll save you from myself
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
I've learned that it's okay to be selfish
It keeps me from falling apart at the seams
Stuck is where I feel in place
A feeling I'll embrace
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
So much for bad luck
If I built a boat with apologies I've got
I'd have a sorry looking raft
It always rains
But it's nice to see
That someone else is sad
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
The coin's faced up
But I'm not feeling any better
A soap box made for every single fuck up
It's tough seeing where I am
Instead of where I'm from
My roots can get loose
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
Can you find your calling if nothing is calling for you?
I'm coughing up a lung trying to get rid of you
To get rid of you
To get rid of you
Can you find your calling
If nothing's calling for you?
For you?
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
When I heard my parents cry
I realized that we're all lost kids
Trying to find our way home
Blood is thicker than water
And I still feel like everyone I love forgot how to swim
At least there are pictures of my sister and me
Hanging on the wall in my garage
They always give me peace of mind
They always give me peace of mind
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I'm starting to see that
We're always changing
It's just so weird to think that we're always changing
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
I never spent my youth thinking of half the shit I'd go through
Living in the past never helped me
Last night I drove past the house that I grew up in
And tried to find that happiness
Living in the past never helped me
Or anyone move forward
There's no love, no growth for me here
Anymore, anymore
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I know this place is the same and that I'm changing
And I'm just
When I get stopped by a train on my drive home
I don't let it get to me like the rest of the world
I smile and think about how much I've grown over this year
It gives me time to open my mind and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that train
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine without you
I've laid to rest the shit that was always out of my hands
I finally sent all my skeletons away
Like everything I couldn't fix and people I couldn't change
Konstantine always tore me apart and made me cry
Now I hear that song and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that...
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine
Happiness, won't get me over this
Happiness, won't get me over anything, over anything 
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I spend my nights thinking the worst
And telling myself that everything's going to work out
I keep kicking myself in the mouth
Opening up every cut that should be a scar by now
I need the hope I always tell my friends about
I need the hope I always tell my friends about
I sleep with the TV on, it covers up my feelings about the past
Here I am lying awake thinking about how things used to be
I'm sick and tired
I'm sick and tired of being at the same old place in my head
Give me peace of mind
I always backtrack to my old self
When I'm holding on to despair and cracks in my life
I'm holding on when I need to let go
I sleep with the TV on, it covers up my feelings about the past
Here I am lying awake thinking about how things used to be
Doubt is the soil that fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
Doubt is the soil that fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
Doubt is the story of how fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
I'm dirty from head to toe
I'm dirty from head to toe
 

I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out

But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)

"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want
Knock me down
I'm not sure I have it in me to get back up
To be who I am seems exhausting anyway
You have a lot in common with my conscience
You both erase my confidence
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Back and forth
Between some kind of vague attachment to yesterday
And never knowing what form of myself I'll get today (to get today)
I'll always be a faded sign in your eyes
No matter what the point of view (point of view)
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
I'm not here
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want to hear
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Would you notice I'm not here
Am I telling myself the truth?
I'm used to pretending to be strong and clueless
Am I doing this right by you?
I seem to be coming off as wrong and ruthless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I changing my mind again?
All this indecision makes me shift my focus
Is the tension my only friend?
Anxiety holds my hand when life gets hopeless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I telling myself the truth about my self-esteem
And how others place their worth in me?
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
(The eyes of someone else)
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
Yeah, I'll keep smiling on the surface
(Am I telling myself the truth?)
"Smiling On The Surface" is the 3rd song released from the album "Composure". It was premiered on June 18, 2018.
Swallowing a feeling
Counting cracks across the ceiling
Never reached the depths of them before
Finding flaws in every format
I know but haven't shown that
I could pick myself up off the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Redefine rock bottom with these empty orange bottles
Never felt so paralysed before (never felt this paralysed)
We're all looking for some answers
With the hangman's broken lantern
Growing ever closer to the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Why do I, why do I, feel so damn cold?
Why am I, why am I, still so low?
Why should I, why should I, get up or get out?
Why should I?
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
Soft spoken, if ever out loud
These days not much gets out
My mind digs graves through the past
But never takes time to finish the act
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
No matter how cold it might get
My bed sheets are laced with regret
I try to fill in the lines
Rework the plans for a better design
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Here I am, bearing every burden
Here I am, showing every worry
To the world
To the world
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try
I'm at best your second option
Like a key under the mat
Are my emotions hard to read?
Seems I'm good at hiding
Reality
You disregard the consequences
Always seem to shift the blame
You burn the bridge and then I build it
Seems you're good at hiding
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
You make me feel helpless
Like a bird with broken wings
Forcing me to be more selfless
Lean on me, don't knock me over
It seems we're good at hiding
It seems we're good at fighting
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
I'm all alone
I feel sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
I'm all alone
I'm feeling sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
(There's nothing I can do)
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
Is there any chance you could cut me some slack?
Because I've been hanging for a while
From this withered rope
Forcing every sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
What could I ask that you help me hold back
Cause I've been falling for a while
Down this fucking slope
Losing any sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
There's a collage of photos framed
Dating '93 to '95
Though all it shows me is that
I'm just a bad seed
Falling off the family tree
I've got more complaints
More than pleasantries to say
Every monument is idly arranged
Every figure that has ever held importance in my life
I find nobody is who I pictured them to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the faces in reflections of the past
I feel so close but I can't reach through the glass
My life burns out and flickers like the end of a cigarette
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the light in your eyes
Turn the blind eye (Turn the blind eye)
"Why are you hurting me" she screamed from her death bed
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
It's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
The tears run down your cheekbones
I feel sorry for you
But I'm too fucking selfish to say I do
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be different
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Today I ripped myself wide open
And I saw that my heart isn't as fucked as I recalled
It's still flawed and
It's sorely stitched to my old ways
I thought it was buried, but it's just stuck
To my old ways
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be something else
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Shaking in the driver's seat
Staring at the dashboard
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
Please just stay
Please just stay
You see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
To take a chance on me
To take a chance
I still see us sitting on that old couch
'Til the sun comes up
Listening to sad songs
We spent our time with smiles on our faces
I know it sounds selfish but I'll miss those days
I know it sounds selfish
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
The Fall leaves flying through the driveway
Keep triggering these memories of you
I'm torn apart with how our lives are changing
I'm sure it sounds selfish, I'm just being honest
I know it sounds selfish
But I'm trying to be honest
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
Let's go back to when thing weren't complicated
Let's go back to all those old dashboard songs
Let's go back to smoking on the side of my old house
We can never go back, we'll never go back
We'll never go back
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
I know it sounds selfish
I'm just being honest
I can't fix everything around me
I can't make everybody happy
And it'll be okay
Show me how to be something other than nostalgic
I want to feel inspired and innocent again
I just want to be worth your time
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Lately when I'm alone I keep thinking about the past
I'm trying to feel weak in my knees again
I want to stand up straight like when I graduated
I just want to be
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Do you remember when you saw right through my selfish skin?
Do you remember when I ignored everything you did?
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
It'll be okay
We rush through our lives
Just to feel some kind of pride
Dismissing actualities is making matters worse
The ink will fade, but won't go away
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
I live in the middle of a lake
And I don't know how to swim
I've isolated everything
Everywhere I go I am consistently alone
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
Cautions only ever made me worry
You know that cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
The patience I once had is running away with my youth
Away in its hands
I've been neglecting who I am
That's just who I was back then
Don't need to be perfect, just happy
I'm still a lost boy
I'm still a lost boy
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
Every once in a while I listen to Death Cab and think about how it used to be 
We thought that we knew the answers
When no one was asking
Asking the questions 
I'm still a lost boy 
I'm still a lost boy 
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
It feels like I've been taking the long way for a while now
Haven't been at home in more years than I care to say
I keep letting my past cover what the present shouldn't be
What I shouldn't be
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
Staring out the window in my bedroom makes me think back
I see me as a boy out there
Lying in the grass
Singing songs with all the wrong notes
And graduating high school as my mom cries
I'm writing the same song over and over again
And feeling lost
I've always felt so lost
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I clenched the wheel the whole way home from Cleveland
With nothing more than my eyes half way open
And my hand smelling like smoke
Each mile I drive gets me closer to the streets that made me feel alone
I'm out of place and it doesn't feel wrong
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I care too much
While you don't even care at all
It's just sad that you don't even care
I walk up the stairs to your apartment and I feel small
The lowest feelings and even lower standards
Pictures of simple times are on the top shelf
You lie to me and say you're happy with the way things are
With the way things are
It's just sad, oh it's sad that you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I spent so much damn time trying to move forward
It hurts me to watch you falling backwards
Brave your life
Finding solutions, not making excuses
Find solutions and stop waiting for excuses
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I care too much, while you don't even care at all
A bit much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different
Don't settle because you're scared
You know I pictured things to be different
I pictured things to be different for you
For you
Could you stay here 'til I fall asleep?
We'll pretend that we could make each other feel complete
I'm looking for something that's not inside of you
Will you think of me when you drive home?
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
Last night I closed my eyes
And thought about someone that wasn't you
The weight of the world slipped off my shoulders
And weighed my back to the floor
It isn't where you want to be
I know this isn't where you want to be
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
You tell me I'm broken
As I stare out my window at the street lights
I walk outside and I sit in the shade at 3am
And I feel whole again
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
And I know we're disconnected
I'm getting pretty good at leaving, my patience isn't wearing thin
Autumn never ends in my head, no matter how far I've been
It feels like everybody is the branch and I'm the leaves
Falling from the top of every leafless tree
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
All I see is the past two years before I hit the ground
Time is moving slower on the way down (on the way down)
Save your time spent wondering what's going through my mind
Let me go before you see me following behind
I'll save you from myself
Just let me go
I'll save you from myself
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
I've learned that it's okay to be selfish
It keeps me from falling apart at the seams
Stuck is where I feel in place
A feeling I'll embrace
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
So much for bad luck
If I built a boat with apologies I've got
I'd have a sorry looking raft
It always rains
But it's nice to see
That someone else is sad
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
The coin's faced up
But I'm not feeling any better
A soap box made for every single fuck up
It's tough seeing where I am
Instead of where I'm from
My roots can get loose
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
Can you find your calling if nothing is calling for you?
I'm coughing up a lung trying to get rid of you
To get rid of you
To get rid of you
Can you find your calling
If nothing's calling for you?
For you?
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
When I heard my parents cry
I realized that we're all lost kids
Trying to find our way home
Blood is thicker than water
And I still feel like everyone I love forgot how to swim
At least there are pictures of my sister and me
Hanging on the wall in my garage
They always give me peace of mind
They always give me peace of mind
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I'm starting to see that
We're always changing
It's just so weird to think that we're always changing
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
I never spent my youth thinking of half the shit I'd go through
Living in the past never helped me
Last night I drove past the house that I grew up in
And tried to find that happiness
Living in the past never helped me
Or anyone move forward
There's no love, no growth for me here
Anymore, anymore
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I know this place is the same and that I'm changing
And I'm just
When I get stopped by a train on my drive home
I don't let it get to me like the rest of the world
I smile and think about how much I've grown over this year
It gives me time to open my mind and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that train
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine without you
I've laid to rest the shit that was always out of my hands
I finally sent all my skeletons away
Like everything I couldn't fix and people I couldn't change
Konstantine always tore me apart and made me cry
Now I hear that song and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that...
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine
Happiness, won't get me over this
Happiness, won't get me over anything, over anything 
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I spend my nights thinking the worst
And telling myself that everything's going to work out
I keep kicking myself in the mouth
Opening up every cut that should be a scar by now
I need the hope I always tell my friends about
I need the hope I always tell my friends about
I sleep with the TV on, it covers up my feelings about the past
Here I am lying awake thinking about how things used to be
I'm sick and tired
I'm sick and tired of being at the same old place in my head
Give me peace of mind
I always backtrack to my old self
When I'm holding on to despair and cracks in my life
I'm holding on when I need to let go
I sleep with the TV on, it covers up my feelings about the past
Here I am lying awake thinking about how things used to be
Doubt is the soil that fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
Doubt is the soil that fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
Doubt is the story of how fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
I'm dirty from head to toe
I'm dirty from head to toe
Change holds me down to the places I don't want to be
When I wake up I look in the mirror and I see
The person that's been scaring me away from moving on
And getting out of my head
I end my nights in the same spot that I told myself I would leave
I want to come home and have it be like it was before I left
I'm starting to see that I keep living alone in the past
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
I can't shake it off
Always a fight between my past,
My head, and my heart, you can cut me up
And spread me all over Illinois
I can't, I can't find myself
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
I'm stuck and I feel like I'm the only one
I end my nights in the same spot that I told myself I would leave
I want to come home and have it be like it was before I left
I'm starting to see that I keep living alone in the past
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
Did I get left behind?
Or is everybody else just hiding that they're lost
Loneliness will never leave my mind
Loneliness will never leave my mind
Did I get left behind?
Or is everybody else just hiding that they're lost
 

I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want
Knock me down
I'm not sure I have it in me to get back up
To be who I am seems exhausting anyway
You have a lot in common with my conscience
You both erase my confidence
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Back and forth
Between some kind of vague attachment to yesterday
And never knowing what form of myself I'll get today (to get today)
I'll always be a faded sign in your eyes
No matter what the point of view (point of view)
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
I'm not here
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want to hear
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Would you notice I'm not here
Am I telling myself the truth?
I'm used to pretending to be strong and clueless
Am I doing this right by you?
I seem to be coming off as wrong and ruthless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I changing my mind again?
All this indecision makes me shift my focus
Is the tension my only friend?
Anxiety holds my hand when life gets hopeless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I telling myself the truth about my self-esteem
And how others place their worth in me?
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
(The eyes of someone else)
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
Yeah, I'll keep smiling on the surface
(Am I telling myself the truth?)
"Smiling On The Surface" is the 3rd song released from the album "Composure". It was premiered on June 18, 2018.
Swallowing a feeling
Counting cracks across the ceiling
Never reached the depths of them before
Finding flaws in every format
I know but haven't shown that
I could pick myself up off the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Redefine rock bottom with these empty orange bottles
Never felt so paralysed before (never felt this paralysed)
We're all looking for some answers
With the hangman's broken lantern
Growing ever closer to the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Why do I, why do I, feel so damn cold?
Why am I, why am I, still so low?
Why should I, why should I, get up or get out?
Why should I?
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
Soft spoken, if ever out loud
These days not much gets out
My mind digs graves through the past
But never takes time to finish the act
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
No matter how cold it might get
My bed sheets are laced with regret
I try to fill in the lines
Rework the plans for a better design
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Here I am, bearing every burden
Here I am, showing every worry
To the world
To the world
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try
I'm at best your second option
Like a key under the mat
Are my emotions hard to read?
Seems I'm good at hiding
Reality
You disregard the consequences
Always seem to shift the blame
You burn the bridge and then I build it
Seems you're good at hiding
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
You make me feel helpless
Like a bird with broken wings
Forcing me to be more selfless
Lean on me, don't knock me over
It seems we're good at hiding
It seems we're good at fighting
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
I'm all alone
I feel sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
I'm all alone
I'm feeling sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
(There's nothing I can do)
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
Is there any chance you could cut me some slack?
Because I've been hanging for a while
From this withered rope
Forcing every sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
What could I ask that you help me hold back
Cause I've been falling for a while
Down this fucking slope
Losing any sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
There's a collage of photos framed
Dating '93 to '95
Though all it shows me is that
I'm just a bad seed
Falling off the family tree
I've got more complaints
More than pleasantries to say
Every monument is idly arranged
Every figure that has ever held importance in my life
I find nobody is who I pictured them to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the faces in reflections of the past
I feel so close but I can't reach through the glass
My life burns out and flickers like the end of a cigarette
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the light in your eyes
Turn the blind eye (Turn the blind eye)
"Why are you hurting me" she screamed from her death bed
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
It's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
The tears run down your cheekbones
I feel sorry for you
But I'm too fucking selfish to say I do
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be different
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Today I ripped myself wide open
And I saw that my heart isn't as fucked as I recalled
It's still flawed and
It's sorely stitched to my old ways
I thought it was buried, but it's just stuck
To my old ways
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be something else
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Shaking in the driver's seat
Staring at the dashboard
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
Please just stay
Please just stay
You see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
To take a chance on me
To take a chance
I still see us sitting on that old couch
'Til the sun comes up
Listening to sad songs
We spent our time with smiles on our faces
I know it sounds selfish but I'll miss those days
I know it sounds selfish
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
The Fall leaves flying through the driveway
Keep triggering these memories of you
I'm torn apart with how our lives are changing
I'm sure it sounds selfish, I'm just being honest
I know it sounds selfish
But I'm trying to be honest
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
Let's go back to when thing weren't complicated
Let's go back to all those old dashboard songs
Let's go back to smoking on the side of my old house
We can never go back, we'll never go back
We'll never go back
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
I know it sounds selfish
I'm just being honest
I can't fix everything around me
I can't make everybody happy
And it'll be okay
Show me how to be something other than nostalgic
I want to feel inspired and innocent again
I just want to be worth your time
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Lately when I'm alone I keep thinking about the past
I'm trying to feel weak in my knees again
I want to stand up straight like when I graduated
I just want to be
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Do you remember when you saw right through my selfish skin?
Do you remember when I ignored everything you did?
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
It'll be okay
We rush through our lives
Just to feel some kind of pride
Dismissing actualities is making matters worse
The ink will fade, but won't go away
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
I live in the middle of a lake
And I don't know how to swim
I've isolated everything
Everywhere I go I am consistently alone
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
Cautions only ever made me worry
You know that cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
The patience I once had is running away with my youth
Away in its hands
I've been neglecting who I am
That's just who I was back then
Don't need to be perfect, just happy
I'm still a lost boy
I'm still a lost boy
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
Every once in a while I listen to Death Cab and think about how it used to be 
We thought that we knew the answers
When no one was asking
Asking the questions 
I'm still a lost boy 
I'm still a lost boy 
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
It feels like I've been taking the long way for a while now
Haven't been at home in more years than I care to say
I keep letting my past cover what the present shouldn't be
What I shouldn't be
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
Staring out the window in my bedroom makes me think back
I see me as a boy out there
Lying in the grass
Singing songs with all the wrong notes
And graduating high school as my mom cries
I'm writing the same song over and over again
And feeling lost
I've always felt so lost
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I clenched the wheel the whole way home from Cleveland
With nothing more than my eyes half way open
And my hand smelling like smoke
Each mile I drive gets me closer to the streets that made me feel alone
I'm out of place and it doesn't feel wrong
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I care too much
While you don't even care at all
It's just sad that you don't even care
I walk up the stairs to your apartment and I feel small
The lowest feelings and even lower standards
Pictures of simple times are on the top shelf
You lie to me and say you're happy with the way things are
With the way things are
It's just sad, oh it's sad that you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I spent so much damn time trying to move forward
It hurts me to watch you falling backwards
Brave your life
Finding solutions, not making excuses
Find solutions and stop waiting for excuses
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I care too much, while you don't even care at all
A bit much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different
Don't settle because you're scared
You know I pictured things to be different
I pictured things to be different for you
For you
Could you stay here 'til I fall asleep?
We'll pretend that we could make each other feel complete
I'm looking for something that's not inside of you
Will you think of me when you drive home?
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
Last night I closed my eyes
And thought about someone that wasn't you
The weight of the world slipped off my shoulders
And weighed my back to the floor
It isn't where you want to be
I know this isn't where you want to be
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
You tell me I'm broken
As I stare out my window at the street lights
I walk outside and I sit in the shade at 3am
And I feel whole again
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
And I know we're disconnected
I'm getting pretty good at leaving, my patience isn't wearing thin
Autumn never ends in my head, no matter how far I've been
It feels like everybody is the branch and I'm the leaves
Falling from the top of every leafless tree
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
All I see is the past two years before I hit the ground
Time is moving slower on the way down (on the way down)
Save your time spent wondering what's going through my mind
Let me go before you see me following behind
I'll save you from myself
Just let me go
I'll save you from myself
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
I've learned that it's okay to be selfish
It keeps me from falling apart at the seams
Stuck is where I feel in place
A feeling I'll embrace
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
So much for bad luck
If I built a boat with apologies I've got
I'd have a sorry looking raft
It always rains
But it's nice to see
That someone else is sad
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
The coin's faced up
But I'm not feeling any better
A soap box made for every single fuck up
It's tough seeing where I am
Instead of where I'm from
My roots can get loose
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
Can you find your calling if nothing is calling for you?
I'm coughing up a lung trying to get rid of you
To get rid of you
To get rid of you
Can you find your calling
If nothing's calling for you?
For you?
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
When I heard my parents cry
I realized that we're all lost kids
Trying to find our way home
Blood is thicker than water
And I still feel like everyone I love forgot how to swim
At least there are pictures of my sister and me
Hanging on the wall in my garage
They always give me peace of mind
They always give me peace of mind
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I'm starting to see that
We're always changing
It's just so weird to think that we're always changing
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
I never spent my youth thinking of half the shit I'd go through
Living in the past never helped me
Last night I drove past the house that I grew up in
And tried to find that happiness
Living in the past never helped me
Or anyone move forward
There's no love, no growth for me here
Anymore, anymore
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I know this place is the same and that I'm changing
And I'm just
When I get stopped by a train on my drive home
I don't let it get to me like the rest of the world
I smile and think about how much I've grown over this year
It gives me time to open my mind and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that train
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine without you
I've laid to rest the shit that was always out of my hands
I finally sent all my skeletons away
Like everything I couldn't fix and people I couldn't change
Konstantine always tore me apart and made me cry
Now I hear that song and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that...
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine
Happiness, won't get me over this
Happiness, won't get me over anything, over anything 
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I spend my nights thinking the worst
And telling myself that everything's going to work out
I keep kicking myself in the mouth
Opening up every cut that should be a scar by now
I need the hope I always tell my friends about
I need the hope I always tell my friends about
I sleep with the TV on, it covers up my feelings about the past
Here I am lying awake thinking about how things used to be
I'm sick and tired
I'm sick and tired of being at the same old place in my head
Give me peace of mind
I always backtrack to my old self
When I'm holding on to despair and cracks in my life
I'm holding on when I need to let go
I sleep with the TV on, it covers up my feelings about the past
Here I am lying awake thinking about how things used to be
Doubt is the soil that fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
Doubt is the soil that fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
Doubt is the story of how fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
I'm dirty from head to toe
I'm dirty from head to toe
Change holds me down to the places I don't want to be
When I wake up I look in the mirror and I see
The person that's been scaring me away from moving on
And getting out of my head
I end my nights in the same spot that I told myself I would leave
I want to come home and have it be like it was before I left
I'm starting to see that I keep living alone in the past
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
I can't shake it off
Always a fight between my past,
My head, and my heart, you can cut me up
And spread me all over Illinois
I can't, I can't find myself
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
I'm stuck and I feel like I'm the only one
I end my nights in the same spot that I told myself I would leave
I want to come home and have it be like it was before I left
I'm starting to see that I keep living alone in the past
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
Did I get left behind?
Or is everybody else just hiding that they're lost
Loneliness will never leave my mind
Loneliness will never leave my mind
Did I get left behind?
Or is everybody else just hiding that they're lost
Just when I think I need someone, 
They wrap their arms around my old bones 
And I start breaking apart
I walk away from anyone that cares about me
But I swear my skin's not as rough as I make it out to be
The saddest part is I've been distant since I was sixteen
It keeps me up in bed
I'm stuck here with all the choices I've made 
And the chances I was too afraid to take
I've called myself young and stupid, 
But lately I feel old and desperate
I find it kind of weird how you find yourself 
When you have no one
I look for the right things in all the wrong places
The saddest part is I've been distant since I was sixteen
It keeps me up in bed
I'm stuck here with all the choices I've made 
And the chances I was too afraid to take
 

I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm

Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want
Knock me down
I'm not sure I have it in me to get back up
To be who I am seems exhausting anyway
You have a lot in common with my conscience
You both erase my confidence
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Back and forth
Between some kind of vague attachment to yesterday
And never knowing what form of myself I'll get today (to get today)
I'll always be a faded sign in your eyes
No matter what the point of view (point of view)
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
I'm not here
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want to hear
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Would you notice I'm not here
Am I telling myself the truth?
I'm used to pretending to be strong and clueless
Am I doing this right by you?
I seem to be coming off as wrong and ruthless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I changing my mind again?
All this indecision makes me shift my focus
Is the tension my only friend?
Anxiety holds my hand when life gets hopeless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I telling myself the truth about my self-esteem
And how others place their worth in me?
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
(The eyes of someone else)
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
Yeah, I'll keep smiling on the surface
(Am I telling myself the truth?)
"Smiling On The Surface" is the 3rd song released from the album "Composure". It was premiered on June 18, 2018.
Swallowing a feeling
Counting cracks across the ceiling
Never reached the depths of them before
Finding flaws in every format
I know but haven't shown that
I could pick myself up off the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Redefine rock bottom with these empty orange bottles
Never felt so paralysed before (never felt this paralysed)
We're all looking for some answers
With the hangman's broken lantern
Growing ever closer to the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Why do I, why do I, feel so damn cold?
Why am I, why am I, still so low?
Why should I, why should I, get up or get out?
Why should I?
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
Soft spoken, if ever out loud
These days not much gets out
My mind digs graves through the past
But never takes time to finish the act
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
No matter how cold it might get
My bed sheets are laced with regret
I try to fill in the lines
Rework the plans for a better design
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Here I am, bearing every burden
Here I am, showing every worry
To the world
To the world
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try
I'm at best your second option
Like a key under the mat
Are my emotions hard to read?
Seems I'm good at hiding
Reality
You disregard the consequences
Always seem to shift the blame
You burn the bridge and then I build it
Seems you're good at hiding
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
You make me feel helpless
Like a bird with broken wings
Forcing me to be more selfless
Lean on me, don't knock me over
It seems we're good at hiding
It seems we're good at fighting
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
I'm all alone
I feel sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
I'm all alone
I'm feeling sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
(There's nothing I can do)
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
Is there any chance you could cut me some slack?
Because I've been hanging for a while
From this withered rope
Forcing every sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
What could I ask that you help me hold back
Cause I've been falling for a while
Down this fucking slope
Losing any sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
There's a collage of photos framed
Dating '93 to '95
Though all it shows me is that
I'm just a bad seed
Falling off the family tree
I've got more complaints
More than pleasantries to say
Every monument is idly arranged
Every figure that has ever held importance in my life
I find nobody is who I pictured them to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the faces in reflections of the past
I feel so close but I can't reach through the glass
My life burns out and flickers like the end of a cigarette
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the light in your eyes
Turn the blind eye (Turn the blind eye)
"Why are you hurting me" she screamed from her death bed
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
It's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
The tears run down your cheekbones
I feel sorry for you
But I'm too fucking selfish to say I do
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be different
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Today I ripped myself wide open
And I saw that my heart isn't as fucked as I recalled
It's still flawed and
It's sorely stitched to my old ways
I thought it was buried, but it's just stuck
To my old ways
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be something else
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Shaking in the driver's seat
Staring at the dashboard
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
Please just stay
Please just stay
You see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
To take a chance on me
To take a chance
I still see us sitting on that old couch
'Til the sun comes up
Listening to sad songs
We spent our time with smiles on our faces
I know it sounds selfish but I'll miss those days
I know it sounds selfish
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
The Fall leaves flying through the driveway
Keep triggering these memories of you
I'm torn apart with how our lives are changing
I'm sure it sounds selfish, I'm just being honest
I know it sounds selfish
But I'm trying to be honest
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
Let's go back to when thing weren't complicated
Let's go back to all those old dashboard songs
Let's go back to smoking on the side of my old house
We can never go back, we'll never go back
We'll never go back
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
I know it sounds selfish
I'm just being honest
I can't fix everything around me
I can't make everybody happy
And it'll be okay
Show me how to be something other than nostalgic
I want to feel inspired and innocent again
I just want to be worth your time
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Lately when I'm alone I keep thinking about the past
I'm trying to feel weak in my knees again
I want to stand up straight like when I graduated
I just want to be
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Do you remember when you saw right through my selfish skin?
Do you remember when I ignored everything you did?
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
It'll be okay
We rush through our lives
Just to feel some kind of pride
Dismissing actualities is making matters worse
The ink will fade, but won't go away
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
I live in the middle of a lake
And I don't know how to swim
I've isolated everything
Everywhere I go I am consistently alone
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
Cautions only ever made me worry
You know that cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
The patience I once had is running away with my youth
Away in its hands
I've been neglecting who I am
That's just who I was back then
Don't need to be perfect, just happy
I'm still a lost boy
I'm still a lost boy
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
Every once in a while I listen to Death Cab and think about how it used to be 
We thought that we knew the answers
When no one was asking
Asking the questions 
I'm still a lost boy 
I'm still a lost boy 
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
It feels like I've been taking the long way for a while now
Haven't been at home in more years than I care to say
I keep letting my past cover what the present shouldn't be
What I shouldn't be
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
Staring out the window in my bedroom makes me think back
I see me as a boy out there
Lying in the grass
Singing songs with all the wrong notes
And graduating high school as my mom cries
I'm writing the same song over and over again
And feeling lost
I've always felt so lost
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I clenched the wheel the whole way home from Cleveland
With nothing more than my eyes half way open
And my hand smelling like smoke
Each mile I drive gets me closer to the streets that made me feel alone
I'm out of place and it doesn't feel wrong
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I care too much
While you don't even care at all
It's just sad that you don't even care
I walk up the stairs to your apartment and I feel small
The lowest feelings and even lower standards
Pictures of simple times are on the top shelf
You lie to me and say you're happy with the way things are
With the way things are
It's just sad, oh it's sad that you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I spent so much damn time trying to move forward
It hurts me to watch you falling backwards
Brave your life
Finding solutions, not making excuses
Find solutions and stop waiting for excuses
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I care too much, while you don't even care at all
A bit much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different
Don't settle because you're scared
You know I pictured things to be different
I pictured things to be different for you
For you
Could you stay here 'til I fall asleep?
We'll pretend that we could make each other feel complete
I'm looking for something that's not inside of you
Will you think of me when you drive home?
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
Last night I closed my eyes
And thought about someone that wasn't you
The weight of the world slipped off my shoulders
And weighed my back to the floor
It isn't where you want to be
I know this isn't where you want to be
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
You tell me I'm broken
As I stare out my window at the street lights
I walk outside and I sit in the shade at 3am
And I feel whole again
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
And I know we're disconnected
I'm getting pretty good at leaving, my patience isn't wearing thin
Autumn never ends in my head, no matter how far I've been
It feels like everybody is the branch and I'm the leaves
Falling from the top of every leafless tree
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
All I see is the past two years before I hit the ground
Time is moving slower on the way down (on the way down)
Save your time spent wondering what's going through my mind
Let me go before you see me following behind
I'll save you from myself
Just let me go
I'll save you from myself
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
I've learned that it's okay to be selfish
It keeps me from falling apart at the seams
Stuck is where I feel in place
A feeling I'll embrace
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
So much for bad luck
If I built a boat with apologies I've got
I'd have a sorry looking raft
It always rains
But it's nice to see
That someone else is sad
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
The coin's faced up
But I'm not feeling any better
A soap box made for every single fuck up
It's tough seeing where I am
Instead of where I'm from
My roots can get loose
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
Can you find your calling if nothing is calling for you?
I'm coughing up a lung trying to get rid of you
To get rid of you
To get rid of you
Can you find your calling
If nothing's calling for you?
For you?
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
When I heard my parents cry
I realized that we're all lost kids
Trying to find our way home
Blood is thicker than water
And I still feel like everyone I love forgot how to swim
At least there are pictures of my sister and me
Hanging on the wall in my garage
They always give me peace of mind
They always give me peace of mind
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I'm starting to see that
We're always changing
It's just so weird to think that we're always changing
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
I never spent my youth thinking of half the shit I'd go through
Living in the past never helped me
Last night I drove past the house that I grew up in
And tried to find that happiness
Living in the past never helped me
Or anyone move forward
There's no love, no growth for me here
Anymore, anymore
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I know this place is the same and that I'm changing
And I'm just
When I get stopped by a train on my drive home
I don't let it get to me like the rest of the world
I smile and think about how much I've grown over this year
It gives me time to open my mind and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that train
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine without you
I've laid to rest the shit that was always out of my hands
I finally sent all my skeletons away
Like everything I couldn't fix and people I couldn't change
Konstantine always tore me apart and made me cry
Now I hear that song and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that...
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine
Happiness, won't get me over this
Happiness, won't get me over anything, over anything 
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I spend my nights thinking the worst
And telling myself that everything's going to work out
I keep kicking myself in the mouth
Opening up every cut that should be a scar by now
I need the hope I always tell my friends about
I need the hope I always tell my friends about
I sleep with the TV on, it covers up my feelings about the past
Here I am lying awake thinking about how things used to be
I'm sick and tired
I'm sick and tired of being at the same old place in my head
Give me peace of mind
I always backtrack to my old self
When I'm holding on to despair and cracks in my life
I'm holding on when I need to let go
I sleep with the TV on, it covers up my feelings about the past
Here I am lying awake thinking about how things used to be
Doubt is the soil that fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
Doubt is the soil that fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
Doubt is the story of how fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
I'm dirty from head to toe
I'm dirty from head to toe
Change holds me down to the places I don't want to be
When I wake up I look in the mirror and I see
The person that's been scaring me away from moving on
And getting out of my head
I end my nights in the same spot that I told myself I would leave
I want to come home and have it be like it was before I left
I'm starting to see that I keep living alone in the past
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
I can't shake it off
Always a fight between my past,
My head, and my heart, you can cut me up
And spread me all over Illinois
I can't, I can't find myself
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
I'm stuck and I feel like I'm the only one
I end my nights in the same spot that I told myself I would leave
I want to come home and have it be like it was before I left
I'm starting to see that I keep living alone in the past
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
Did I get left behind?
Or is everybody else just hiding that they're lost
Loneliness will never leave my mind
Loneliness will never leave my mind
Did I get left behind?
Or is everybody else just hiding that they're lost
Just when I think I need someone, 
They wrap their arms around my old bones 
And I start breaking apart
I walk away from anyone that cares about me
But I swear my skin's not as rough as I make it out to be
The saddest part is I've been distant since I was sixteen
It keeps me up in bed
I'm stuck here with all the choices I've made 
And the chances I was too afraid to take
I've called myself young and stupid, 
But lately I feel old and desperate
I find it kind of weird how you find yourself 
When you have no one
I look for the right things in all the wrong places
The saddest part is I've been distant since I was sixteen
It keeps me up in bed
I'm stuck here with all the choices I've made 
And the chances I was too afraid to take
I found myself in a late night drives
Without a destination
All I had were thoughts about the past
And a list of my favorite songs to keep me company
But I still struggle and lose myself everyday
I always find myself lost in every line of all these songs
But I felt better when I saw that this is life
And in life were gonna cry
In life were gonna lose sleep
Were gonna feel helpless
But thats how its got to be 
When you lose yourself you'll find what you're looking for
I'm growing past who I used to be
 

I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk

And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want
Knock me down
I'm not sure I have it in me to get back up
To be who I am seems exhausting anyway
You have a lot in common with my conscience
You both erase my confidence
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Back and forth
Between some kind of vague attachment to yesterday
And never knowing what form of myself I'll get today (to get today)
I'll always be a faded sign in your eyes
No matter what the point of view (point of view)
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
I'm not here
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want to hear
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Would you notice I'm not here
Am I telling myself the truth?
I'm used to pretending to be strong and clueless
Am I doing this right by you?
I seem to be coming off as wrong and ruthless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I changing my mind again?
All this indecision makes me shift my focus
Is the tension my only friend?
Anxiety holds my hand when life gets hopeless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I telling myself the truth about my self-esteem
And how others place their worth in me?
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
(The eyes of someone else)
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
Yeah, I'll keep smiling on the surface
(Am I telling myself the truth?)
"Smiling On The Surface" is the 3rd song released from the album "Composure". It was premiered on June 18, 2018.
Swallowing a feeling
Counting cracks across the ceiling
Never reached the depths of them before
Finding flaws in every format
I know but haven't shown that
I could pick myself up off the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Redefine rock bottom with these empty orange bottles
Never felt so paralysed before (never felt this paralysed)
We're all looking for some answers
With the hangman's broken lantern
Growing ever closer to the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Why do I, why do I, feel so damn cold?
Why am I, why am I, still so low?
Why should I, why should I, get up or get out?
Why should I?
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
Soft spoken, if ever out loud
These days not much gets out
My mind digs graves through the past
But never takes time to finish the act
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
No matter how cold it might get
My bed sheets are laced with regret
I try to fill in the lines
Rework the plans for a better design
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Here I am, bearing every burden
Here I am, showing every worry
To the world
To the world
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try
I'm at best your second option
Like a key under the mat
Are my emotions hard to read?
Seems I'm good at hiding
Reality
You disregard the consequences
Always seem to shift the blame
You burn the bridge and then I build it
Seems you're good at hiding
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
You make me feel helpless
Like a bird with broken wings
Forcing me to be more selfless
Lean on me, don't knock me over
It seems we're good at hiding
It seems we're good at fighting
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
I'm all alone
I feel sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
I'm all alone
I'm feeling sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
(There's nothing I can do)
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
Is there any chance you could cut me some slack?
Because I've been hanging for a while
From this withered rope
Forcing every sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
What could I ask that you help me hold back
Cause I've been falling for a while
Down this fucking slope
Losing any sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
There's a collage of photos framed
Dating '93 to '95
Though all it shows me is that
I'm just a bad seed
Falling off the family tree
I've got more complaints
More than pleasantries to say
Every monument is idly arranged
Every figure that has ever held importance in my life
I find nobody is who I pictured them to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the faces in reflections of the past
I feel so close but I can't reach through the glass
My life burns out and flickers like the end of a cigarette
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the light in your eyes
Turn the blind eye (Turn the blind eye)
"Why are you hurting me" she screamed from her death bed
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
It's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
The tears run down your cheekbones
I feel sorry for you
But I'm too fucking selfish to say I do
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be different
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Today I ripped myself wide open
And I saw that my heart isn't as fucked as I recalled
It's still flawed and
It's sorely stitched to my old ways
I thought it was buried, but it's just stuck
To my old ways
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be something else
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Shaking in the driver's seat
Staring at the dashboard
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
Please just stay
Please just stay
You see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
To take a chance on me
To take a chance
I still see us sitting on that old couch
'Til the sun comes up
Listening to sad songs
We spent our time with smiles on our faces
I know it sounds selfish but I'll miss those days
I know it sounds selfish
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
The Fall leaves flying through the driveway
Keep triggering these memories of you
I'm torn apart with how our lives are changing
I'm sure it sounds selfish, I'm just being honest
I know it sounds selfish
But I'm trying to be honest
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
Let's go back to when thing weren't complicated
Let's go back to all those old dashboard songs
Let's go back to smoking on the side of my old house
We can never go back, we'll never go back
We'll never go back
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
I know it sounds selfish
I'm just being honest
I can't fix everything around me
I can't make everybody happy
And it'll be okay
Show me how to be something other than nostalgic
I want to feel inspired and innocent again
I just want to be worth your time
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Lately when I'm alone I keep thinking about the past
I'm trying to feel weak in my knees again
I want to stand up straight like when I graduated
I just want to be
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Do you remember when you saw right through my selfish skin?
Do you remember when I ignored everything you did?
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
It'll be okay
We rush through our lives
Just to feel some kind of pride
Dismissing actualities is making matters worse
The ink will fade, but won't go away
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
I live in the middle of a lake
And I don't know how to swim
I've isolated everything
Everywhere I go I am consistently alone
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
Cautions only ever made me worry
You know that cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
The patience I once had is running away with my youth
Away in its hands
I've been neglecting who I am
That's just who I was back then
Don't need to be perfect, just happy
I'm still a lost boy
I'm still a lost boy
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
Every once in a while I listen to Death Cab and think about how it used to be 
We thought that we knew the answers
When no one was asking
Asking the questions 
I'm still a lost boy 
I'm still a lost boy 
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
It feels like I've been taking the long way for a while now
Haven't been at home in more years than I care to say
I keep letting my past cover what the present shouldn't be
What I shouldn't be
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
Staring out the window in my bedroom makes me think back
I see me as a boy out there
Lying in the grass
Singing songs with all the wrong notes
And graduating high school as my mom cries
I'm writing the same song over and over again
And feeling lost
I've always felt so lost
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I clenched the wheel the whole way home from Cleveland
With nothing more than my eyes half way open
And my hand smelling like smoke
Each mile I drive gets me closer to the streets that made me feel alone
I'm out of place and it doesn't feel wrong
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I care too much
While you don't even care at all
It's just sad that you don't even care
I walk up the stairs to your apartment and I feel small
The lowest feelings and even lower standards
Pictures of simple times are on the top shelf
You lie to me and say you're happy with the way things are
With the way things are
It's just sad, oh it's sad that you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I spent so much damn time trying to move forward
It hurts me to watch you falling backwards
Brave your life
Finding solutions, not making excuses
Find solutions and stop waiting for excuses
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I care too much, while you don't even care at all
A bit much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different
Don't settle because you're scared
You know I pictured things to be different
I pictured things to be different for you
For you
Could you stay here 'til I fall asleep?
We'll pretend that we could make each other feel complete
I'm looking for something that's not inside of you
Will you think of me when you drive home?
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
Last night I closed my eyes
And thought about someone that wasn't you
The weight of the world slipped off my shoulders
And weighed my back to the floor
It isn't where you want to be
I know this isn't where you want to be
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
You tell me I'm broken
As I stare out my window at the street lights
I walk outside and I sit in the shade at 3am
And I feel whole again
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
And I know we're disconnected
I'm getting pretty good at leaving, my patience isn't wearing thin
Autumn never ends in my head, no matter how far I've been
It feels like everybody is the branch and I'm the leaves
Falling from the top of every leafless tree
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
All I see is the past two years before I hit the ground
Time is moving slower on the way down (on the way down)
Save your time spent wondering what's going through my mind
Let me go before you see me following behind
I'll save you from myself
Just let me go
I'll save you from myself
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
I've learned that it's okay to be selfish
It keeps me from falling apart at the seams
Stuck is where I feel in place
A feeling I'll embrace
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
So much for bad luck
If I built a boat with apologies I've got
I'd have a sorry looking raft
It always rains
But it's nice to see
That someone else is sad
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
The coin's faced up
But I'm not feeling any better
A soap box made for every single fuck up
It's tough seeing where I am
Instead of where I'm from
My roots can get loose
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
Can you find your calling if nothing is calling for you?
I'm coughing up a lung trying to get rid of you
To get rid of you
To get rid of you
Can you find your calling
If nothing's calling for you?
For you?
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
When I heard my parents cry
I realized that we're all lost kids
Trying to find our way home
Blood is thicker than water
And I still feel like everyone I love forgot how to swim
At least there are pictures of my sister and me
Hanging on the wall in my garage
They always give me peace of mind
They always give me peace of mind
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I'm starting to see that
We're always changing
It's just so weird to think that we're always changing
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
I never spent my youth thinking of half the shit I'd go through
Living in the past never helped me
Last night I drove past the house that I grew up in
And tried to find that happiness
Living in the past never helped me
Or anyone move forward
There's no love, no growth for me here
Anymore, anymore
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I know this place is the same and that I'm changing
And I'm just
When I get stopped by a train on my drive home
I don't let it get to me like the rest of the world
I smile and think about how much I've grown over this year
It gives me time to open my mind and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that train
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine without you
I've laid to rest the shit that was always out of my hands
I finally sent all my skeletons away
Like everything I couldn't fix and people I couldn't change
Konstantine always tore me apart and made me cry
Now I hear that song and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that...
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine
Happiness, won't get me over this
Happiness, won't get me over anything, over anything 
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I spend my nights thinking the worst
And telling myself that everything's going to work out
I keep kicking myself in the mouth
Opening up every cut that should be a scar by now
I need the hope I always tell my friends about
I need the hope I always tell my friends about
I sleep with the TV on, it covers up my feelings about the past
Here I am lying awake thinking about how things used to be
I'm sick and tired
I'm sick and tired of being at the same old place in my head
Give me peace of mind
I always backtrack to my old self
When I'm holding on to despair and cracks in my life
I'm holding on when I need to let go
I sleep with the TV on, it covers up my feelings about the past
Here I am lying awake thinking about how things used to be
Doubt is the soil that fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
Doubt is the soil that fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
Doubt is the story of how fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
I'm dirty from head to toe
I'm dirty from head to toe
Change holds me down to the places I don't want to be
When I wake up I look in the mirror and I see
The person that's been scaring me away from moving on
And getting out of my head
I end my nights in the same spot that I told myself I would leave
I want to come home and have it be like it was before I left
I'm starting to see that I keep living alone in the past
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
I can't shake it off
Always a fight between my past,
My head, and my heart, you can cut me up
And spread me all over Illinois
I can't, I can't find myself
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
I'm stuck and I feel like I'm the only one
I end my nights in the same spot that I told myself I would leave
I want to come home and have it be like it was before I left
I'm starting to see that I keep living alone in the past
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
Did I get left behind?
Or is everybody else just hiding that they're lost
Loneliness will never leave my mind
Loneliness will never leave my mind
Did I get left behind?
Or is everybody else just hiding that they're lost
Just when I think I need someone, 
They wrap their arms around my old bones 
And I start breaking apart
I walk away from anyone that cares about me
But I swear my skin's not as rough as I make it out to be
The saddest part is I've been distant since I was sixteen
It keeps me up in bed
I'm stuck here with all the choices I've made 
And the chances I was too afraid to take
I've called myself young and stupid, 
But lately I feel old and desperate
I find it kind of weird how you find yourself 
When you have no one
I look for the right things in all the wrong places
The saddest part is I've been distant since I was sixteen
It keeps me up in bed
I'm stuck here with all the choices I've made 
And the chances I was too afraid to take
I found myself in a late night drives
Without a destination
All I had were thoughts about the past
And a list of my favorite songs to keep me company
But I still struggle and lose myself everyday
I always find myself lost in every line of all these songs
But I felt better when I saw that this is life
And in life were gonna cry
In life were gonna lose sleep
Were gonna feel helpless
But thats how its got to be 
When you lose yourself you'll find what you're looking for
I'm growing past who I used to be
As the night goes on 
I go from feeling out of place to feeling like a ghost
You miss me when I'm gone
But when I'm around it's like I'm hidden behind the paint on the walls
The loneliness will keep me warm tonight
It'll keep me warm seeing as you won't
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more than this
If the open road is my home I'm never leaving
All of the small towns make me throw away my biggest fears
And the big cities make the fucked up stuff feel smaller
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more than this
When I'm not here does anyone miss my secondhand smoke?
Do you wonder where I am or who I'm with?
Call me a mid-twenty sob story
I can't change the way I feel
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more,
Looking for something more
 

I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk

It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want
Knock me down
I'm not sure I have it in me to get back up
To be who I am seems exhausting anyway
You have a lot in common with my conscience
You both erase my confidence
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Back and forth
Between some kind of vague attachment to yesterday
And never knowing what form of myself I'll get today (to get today)
I'll always be a faded sign in your eyes
No matter what the point of view (point of view)
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
I'm not here
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want to hear
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Would you notice I'm not here
Am I telling myself the truth?
I'm used to pretending to be strong and clueless
Am I doing this right by you?
I seem to be coming off as wrong and ruthless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I changing my mind again?
All this indecision makes me shift my focus
Is the tension my only friend?
Anxiety holds my hand when life gets hopeless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I telling myself the truth about my self-esteem
And how others place their worth in me?
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
(The eyes of someone else)
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
Yeah, I'll keep smiling on the surface
(Am I telling myself the truth?)
"Smiling On The Surface" is the 3rd song released from the album "Composure". It was premiered on June 18, 2018.
Swallowing a feeling
Counting cracks across the ceiling
Never reached the depths of them before
Finding flaws in every format
I know but haven't shown that
I could pick myself up off the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Redefine rock bottom with these empty orange bottles
Never felt so paralysed before (never felt this paralysed)
We're all looking for some answers
With the hangman's broken lantern
Growing ever closer to the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Why do I, why do I, feel so damn cold?
Why am I, why am I, still so low?
Why should I, why should I, get up or get out?
Why should I?
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
Soft spoken, if ever out loud
These days not much gets out
My mind digs graves through the past
But never takes time to finish the act
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
No matter how cold it might get
My bed sheets are laced with regret
I try to fill in the lines
Rework the plans for a better design
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Here I am, bearing every burden
Here I am, showing every worry
To the world
To the world
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try
I'm at best your second option
Like a key under the mat
Are my emotions hard to read?
Seems I'm good at hiding
Reality
You disregard the consequences
Always seem to shift the blame
You burn the bridge and then I build it
Seems you're good at hiding
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
You make me feel helpless
Like a bird with broken wings
Forcing me to be more selfless
Lean on me, don't knock me over
It seems we're good at hiding
It seems we're good at fighting
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
I'm all alone
I feel sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
I'm all alone
I'm feeling sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
(There's nothing I can do)
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
Is there any chance you could cut me some slack?
Because I've been hanging for a while
From this withered rope
Forcing every sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
What could I ask that you help me hold back
Cause I've been falling for a while
Down this fucking slope
Losing any sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
There's a collage of photos framed
Dating '93 to '95
Though all it shows me is that
I'm just a bad seed
Falling off the family tree
I've got more complaints
More than pleasantries to say
Every monument is idly arranged
Every figure that has ever held importance in my life
I find nobody is who I pictured them to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the faces in reflections of the past
I feel so close but I can't reach through the glass
My life burns out and flickers like the end of a cigarette
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the light in your eyes
Turn the blind eye (Turn the blind eye)
"Why are you hurting me" she screamed from her death bed
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
It's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
The tears run down your cheekbones
I feel sorry for you
But I'm too fucking selfish to say I do
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be different
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Today I ripped myself wide open
And I saw that my heart isn't as fucked as I recalled
It's still flawed and
It's sorely stitched to my old ways
I thought it was buried, but it's just stuck
To my old ways
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be something else
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Shaking in the driver's seat
Staring at the dashboard
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
Please just stay
Please just stay
You see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
To take a chance on me
To take a chance
I still see us sitting on that old couch
'Til the sun comes up
Listening to sad songs
We spent our time with smiles on our faces
I know it sounds selfish but I'll miss those days
I know it sounds selfish
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
The Fall leaves flying through the driveway
Keep triggering these memories of you
I'm torn apart with how our lives are changing
I'm sure it sounds selfish, I'm just being honest
I know it sounds selfish
But I'm trying to be honest
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
Let's go back to when thing weren't complicated
Let's go back to all those old dashboard songs
Let's go back to smoking on the side of my old house
We can never go back, we'll never go back
We'll never go back
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
I know it sounds selfish
I'm just being honest
I can't fix everything around me
I can't make everybody happy
And it'll be okay
Show me how to be something other than nostalgic
I want to feel inspired and innocent again
I just want to be worth your time
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Lately when I'm alone I keep thinking about the past
I'm trying to feel weak in my knees again
I want to stand up straight like when I graduated
I just want to be
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Do you remember when you saw right through my selfish skin?
Do you remember when I ignored everything you did?
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
It'll be okay
We rush through our lives
Just to feel some kind of pride
Dismissing actualities is making matters worse
The ink will fade, but won't go away
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
I live in the middle of a lake
And I don't know how to swim
I've isolated everything
Everywhere I go I am consistently alone
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
Cautions only ever made me worry
You know that cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
The patience I once had is running away with my youth
Away in its hands
I've been neglecting who I am
That's just who I was back then
Don't need to be perfect, just happy
I'm still a lost boy
I'm still a lost boy
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
Every once in a while I listen to Death Cab and think about how it used to be 
We thought that we knew the answers
When no one was asking
Asking the questions 
I'm still a lost boy 
I'm still a lost boy 
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
It feels like I've been taking the long way for a while now
Haven't been at home in more years than I care to say
I keep letting my past cover what the present shouldn't be
What I shouldn't be
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
Staring out the window in my bedroom makes me think back
I see me as a boy out there
Lying in the grass
Singing songs with all the wrong notes
And graduating high school as my mom cries
I'm writing the same song over and over again
And feeling lost
I've always felt so lost
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I clenched the wheel the whole way home from Cleveland
With nothing more than my eyes half way open
And my hand smelling like smoke
Each mile I drive gets me closer to the streets that made me feel alone
I'm out of place and it doesn't feel wrong
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I care too much
While you don't even care at all
It's just sad that you don't even care
I walk up the stairs to your apartment and I feel small
The lowest feelings and even lower standards
Pictures of simple times are on the top shelf
You lie to me and say you're happy with the way things are
With the way things are
It's just sad, oh it's sad that you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I spent so much damn time trying to move forward
It hurts me to watch you falling backwards
Brave your life
Finding solutions, not making excuses
Find solutions and stop waiting for excuses
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I care too much, while you don't even care at all
A bit much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different
Don't settle because you're scared
You know I pictured things to be different
I pictured things to be different for you
For you
Could you stay here 'til I fall asleep?
We'll pretend that we could make each other feel complete
I'm looking for something that's not inside of you
Will you think of me when you drive home?
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
Last night I closed my eyes
And thought about someone that wasn't you
The weight of the world slipped off my shoulders
And weighed my back to the floor
It isn't where you want to be
I know this isn't where you want to be
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
You tell me I'm broken
As I stare out my window at the street lights
I walk outside and I sit in the shade at 3am
And I feel whole again
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
And I know we're disconnected
I'm getting pretty good at leaving, my patience isn't wearing thin
Autumn never ends in my head, no matter how far I've been
It feels like everybody is the branch and I'm the leaves
Falling from the top of every leafless tree
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
All I see is the past two years before I hit the ground
Time is moving slower on the way down (on the way down)
Save your time spent wondering what's going through my mind
Let me go before you see me following behind
I'll save you from myself
Just let me go
I'll save you from myself
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
I've learned that it's okay to be selfish
It keeps me from falling apart at the seams
Stuck is where I feel in place
A feeling I'll embrace
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
So much for bad luck
If I built a boat with apologies I've got
I'd have a sorry looking raft
It always rains
But it's nice to see
That someone else is sad
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
The coin's faced up
But I'm not feeling any better
A soap box made for every single fuck up
It's tough seeing where I am
Instead of where I'm from
My roots can get loose
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
Can you find your calling if nothing is calling for you?
I'm coughing up a lung trying to get rid of you
To get rid of you
To get rid of you
Can you find your calling
If nothing's calling for you?
For you?
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
When I heard my parents cry
I realized that we're all lost kids
Trying to find our way home
Blood is thicker than water
And I still feel like everyone I love forgot how to swim
At least there are pictures of my sister and me
Hanging on the wall in my garage
They always give me peace of mind
They always give me peace of mind
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I'm starting to see that
We're always changing
It's just so weird to think that we're always changing
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
I never spent my youth thinking of half the shit I'd go through
Living in the past never helped me
Last night I drove past the house that I grew up in
And tried to find that happiness
Living in the past never helped me
Or anyone move forward
There's no love, no growth for me here
Anymore, anymore
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I know this place is the same and that I'm changing
And I'm just
When I get stopped by a train on my drive home
I don't let it get to me like the rest of the world
I smile and think about how much I've grown over this year
It gives me time to open my mind and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that train
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine without you
I've laid to rest the shit that was always out of my hands
I finally sent all my skeletons away
Like everything I couldn't fix and people I couldn't change
Konstantine always tore me apart and made me cry
Now I hear that song and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that...
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine
Happiness, won't get me over this
Happiness, won't get me over anything, over anything 
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I spend my nights thinking the worst
And telling myself that everything's going to work out
I keep kicking myself in the mouth
Opening up every cut that should be a scar by now
I need the hope I always tell my friends about
I need the hope I always tell my friends about
I sleep with the TV on, it covers up my feelings about the past
Here I am lying awake thinking about how things used to be
I'm sick and tired
I'm sick and tired of being at the same old place in my head
Give me peace of mind
I always backtrack to my old self
When I'm holding on to despair and cracks in my life
I'm holding on when I need to let go
I sleep with the TV on, it covers up my feelings about the past
Here I am lying awake thinking about how things used to be
Doubt is the soil that fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
Doubt is the soil that fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
Doubt is the story of how fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
I'm dirty from head to toe
I'm dirty from head to toe
Change holds me down to the places I don't want to be
When I wake up I look in the mirror and I see
The person that's been scaring me away from moving on
And getting out of my head
I end my nights in the same spot that I told myself I would leave
I want to come home and have it be like it was before I left
I'm starting to see that I keep living alone in the past
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
I can't shake it off
Always a fight between my past,
My head, and my heart, you can cut me up
And spread me all over Illinois
I can't, I can't find myself
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
I'm stuck and I feel like I'm the only one
I end my nights in the same spot that I told myself I would leave
I want to come home and have it be like it was before I left
I'm starting to see that I keep living alone in the past
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
Did I get left behind?
Or is everybody else just hiding that they're lost
Loneliness will never leave my mind
Loneliness will never leave my mind
Did I get left behind?
Or is everybody else just hiding that they're lost
Just when I think I need someone, 
They wrap their arms around my old bones 
And I start breaking apart
I walk away from anyone that cares about me
But I swear my skin's not as rough as I make it out to be
The saddest part is I've been distant since I was sixteen
It keeps me up in bed
I'm stuck here with all the choices I've made 
And the chances I was too afraid to take
I've called myself young and stupid, 
But lately I feel old and desperate
I find it kind of weird how you find yourself 
When you have no one
I look for the right things in all the wrong places
The saddest part is I've been distant since I was sixteen
It keeps me up in bed
I'm stuck here with all the choices I've made 
And the chances I was too afraid to take
I found myself in a late night drives
Without a destination
All I had were thoughts about the past
And a list of my favorite songs to keep me company
But I still struggle and lose myself everyday
I always find myself lost in every line of all these songs
But I felt better when I saw that this is life
And in life were gonna cry
In life were gonna lose sleep
Were gonna feel helpless
But thats how its got to be 
When you lose yourself you'll find what you're looking for
I'm growing past who I used to be
As the night goes on 
I go from feeling out of place to feeling like a ghost
You miss me when I'm gone
But when I'm around it's like I'm hidden behind the paint on the walls
The loneliness will keep me warm tonight
It'll keep me warm seeing as you won't
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more than this
If the open road is my home I'm never leaving
All of the small towns make me throw away my biggest fears
And the big cities make the fucked up stuff feel smaller
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more than this
When I'm not here does anyone miss my secondhand smoke?
Do you wonder where I am or who I'm with?
Call me a mid-twenty sob story
I can't change the way I feel
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more,
Looking for something more
You were easy on my eyes
You were heavy on my heart
I never thought I'd live to see today
You're still in my mind
But not in my chest
I'm a little worn out since you fucking tore me down
You made me believe we had something
I guess that I was wrong
I thought I would be numb to this by now
I guess I was wrong
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
Stick with me or don't stick around at all
I was the boy who was too scared and ran away
I was the glue that never dried
You were the girl that made up her mind
And left me all alone to die
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
I'll sit on my basement floor
Turn off all the lights and try to not think about you
Just know that when I'm down there
I'll know that I won't be running through your mind
You were easy on my eyes
You were heavy on my heart
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
And I'll get through the winter without you
You made me believe we had something
Well I guess that I was wrong
 

I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed

Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want
Knock me down
I'm not sure I have it in me to get back up
To be who I am seems exhausting anyway
You have a lot in common with my conscience
You both erase my confidence
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Back and forth
Between some kind of vague attachment to yesterday
And never knowing what form of myself I'll get today (to get today)
I'll always be a faded sign in your eyes
No matter what the point of view (point of view)
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
I'm not here
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want to hear
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Would you notice I'm not here
Am I telling myself the truth?
I'm used to pretending to be strong and clueless
Am I doing this right by you?
I seem to be coming off as wrong and ruthless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I changing my mind again?
All this indecision makes me shift my focus
Is the tension my only friend?
Anxiety holds my hand when life gets hopeless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I telling myself the truth about my self-esteem
And how others place their worth in me?
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
(The eyes of someone else)
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
Yeah, I'll keep smiling on the surface
(Am I telling myself the truth?)
"Smiling On The Surface" is the 3rd song released from the album "Composure". It was premiered on June 18, 2018.
Swallowing a feeling
Counting cracks across the ceiling
Never reached the depths of them before
Finding flaws in every format
I know but haven't shown that
I could pick myself up off the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Redefine rock bottom with these empty orange bottles
Never felt so paralysed before (never felt this paralysed)
We're all looking for some answers
With the hangman's broken lantern
Growing ever closer to the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Why do I, why do I, feel so damn cold?
Why am I, why am I, still so low?
Why should I, why should I, get up or get out?
Why should I?
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
Soft spoken, if ever out loud
These days not much gets out
My mind digs graves through the past
But never takes time to finish the act
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
No matter how cold it might get
My bed sheets are laced with regret
I try to fill in the lines
Rework the plans for a better design
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Here I am, bearing every burden
Here I am, showing every worry
To the world
To the world
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try
I'm at best your second option
Like a key under the mat
Are my emotions hard to read?
Seems I'm good at hiding
Reality
You disregard the consequences
Always seem to shift the blame
You burn the bridge and then I build it
Seems you're good at hiding
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
You make me feel helpless
Like a bird with broken wings
Forcing me to be more selfless
Lean on me, don't knock me over
It seems we're good at hiding
It seems we're good at fighting
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
I'm all alone
I feel sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
I'm all alone
I'm feeling sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
(There's nothing I can do)
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
Is there any chance you could cut me some slack?
Because I've been hanging for a while
From this withered rope
Forcing every sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
What could I ask that you help me hold back
Cause I've been falling for a while
Down this fucking slope
Losing any sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
There's a collage of photos framed
Dating '93 to '95
Though all it shows me is that
I'm just a bad seed
Falling off the family tree
I've got more complaints
More than pleasantries to say
Every monument is idly arranged
Every figure that has ever held importance in my life
I find nobody is who I pictured them to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the faces in reflections of the past
I feel so close but I can't reach through the glass
My life burns out and flickers like the end of a cigarette
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the light in your eyes
Turn the blind eye (Turn the blind eye)
"Why are you hurting me" she screamed from her death bed
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
It's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
The tears run down your cheekbones
I feel sorry for you
But I'm too fucking selfish to say I do
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be different
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Today I ripped myself wide open
And I saw that my heart isn't as fucked as I recalled
It's still flawed and
It's sorely stitched to my old ways
I thought it was buried, but it's just stuck
To my old ways
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be something else
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Shaking in the driver's seat
Staring at the dashboard
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
Please just stay
Please just stay
You see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
To take a chance on me
To take a chance
I still see us sitting on that old couch
'Til the sun comes up
Listening to sad songs
We spent our time with smiles on our faces
I know it sounds selfish but I'll miss those days
I know it sounds selfish
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
The Fall leaves flying through the driveway
Keep triggering these memories of you
I'm torn apart with how our lives are changing
I'm sure it sounds selfish, I'm just being honest
I know it sounds selfish
But I'm trying to be honest
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
Let's go back to when thing weren't complicated
Let's go back to all those old dashboard songs
Let's go back to smoking on the side of my old house
We can never go back, we'll never go back
We'll never go back
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
I know it sounds selfish
I'm just being honest
I can't fix everything around me
I can't make everybody happy
And it'll be okay
Show me how to be something other than nostalgic
I want to feel inspired and innocent again
I just want to be worth your time
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Lately when I'm alone I keep thinking about the past
I'm trying to feel weak in my knees again
I want to stand up straight like when I graduated
I just want to be
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Do you remember when you saw right through my selfish skin?
Do you remember when I ignored everything you did?
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
It'll be okay
We rush through our lives
Just to feel some kind of pride
Dismissing actualities is making matters worse
The ink will fade, but won't go away
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
I live in the middle of a lake
And I don't know how to swim
I've isolated everything
Everywhere I go I am consistently alone
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
Cautions only ever made me worry
You know that cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
The patience I once had is running away with my youth
Away in its hands
I've been neglecting who I am
That's just who I was back then
Don't need to be perfect, just happy
I'm still a lost boy
I'm still a lost boy
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
Every once in a while I listen to Death Cab and think about how it used to be 
We thought that we knew the answers
When no one was asking
Asking the questions 
I'm still a lost boy 
I'm still a lost boy 
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
It feels like I've been taking the long way for a while now
Haven't been at home in more years than I care to say
I keep letting my past cover what the present shouldn't be
What I shouldn't be
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
Staring out the window in my bedroom makes me think back
I see me as a boy out there
Lying in the grass
Singing songs with all the wrong notes
And graduating high school as my mom cries
I'm writing the same song over and over again
And feeling lost
I've always felt so lost
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I clenched the wheel the whole way home from Cleveland
With nothing more than my eyes half way open
And my hand smelling like smoke
Each mile I drive gets me closer to the streets that made me feel alone
I'm out of place and it doesn't feel wrong
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I care too much
While you don't even care at all
It's just sad that you don't even care
I walk up the stairs to your apartment and I feel small
The lowest feelings and even lower standards
Pictures of simple times are on the top shelf
You lie to me and say you're happy with the way things are
With the way things are
It's just sad, oh it's sad that you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I spent so much damn time trying to move forward
It hurts me to watch you falling backwards
Brave your life
Finding solutions, not making excuses
Find solutions and stop waiting for excuses
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I care too much, while you don't even care at all
A bit much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different
Don't settle because you're scared
You know I pictured things to be different
I pictured things to be different for you
For you
Could you stay here 'til I fall asleep?
We'll pretend that we could make each other feel complete
I'm looking for something that's not inside of you
Will you think of me when you drive home?
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
Last night I closed my eyes
And thought about someone that wasn't you
The weight of the world slipped off my shoulders
And weighed my back to the floor
It isn't where you want to be
I know this isn't where you want to be
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
You tell me I'm broken
As I stare out my window at the street lights
I walk outside and I sit in the shade at 3am
And I feel whole again
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
And I know we're disconnected
I'm getting pretty good at leaving, my patience isn't wearing thin
Autumn never ends in my head, no matter how far I've been
It feels like everybody is the branch and I'm the leaves
Falling from the top of every leafless tree
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
All I see is the past two years before I hit the ground
Time is moving slower on the way down (on the way down)
Save your time spent wondering what's going through my mind
Let me go before you see me following behind
I'll save you from myself
Just let me go
I'll save you from myself
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
I've learned that it's okay to be selfish
It keeps me from falling apart at the seams
Stuck is where I feel in place
A feeling I'll embrace
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
So much for bad luck
If I built a boat with apologies I've got
I'd have a sorry looking raft
It always rains
But it's nice to see
That someone else is sad
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
The coin's faced up
But I'm not feeling any better
A soap box made for every single fuck up
It's tough seeing where I am
Instead of where I'm from
My roots can get loose
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
Can you find your calling if nothing is calling for you?
I'm coughing up a lung trying to get rid of you
To get rid of you
To get rid of you
Can you find your calling
If nothing's calling for you?
For you?
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
When I heard my parents cry
I realized that we're all lost kids
Trying to find our way home
Blood is thicker than water
And I still feel like everyone I love forgot how to swim
At least there are pictures of my sister and me
Hanging on the wall in my garage
They always give me peace of mind
They always give me peace of mind
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I'm starting to see that
We're always changing
It's just so weird to think that we're always changing
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
I never spent my youth thinking of half the shit I'd go through
Living in the past never helped me
Last night I drove past the house that I grew up in
And tried to find that happiness
Living in the past never helped me
Or anyone move forward
There's no love, no growth for me here
Anymore, anymore
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I know this place is the same and that I'm changing
And I'm just
When I get stopped by a train on my drive home
I don't let it get to me like the rest of the world
I smile and think about how much I've grown over this year
It gives me time to open my mind and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that train
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine without you
I've laid to rest the shit that was always out of my hands
I finally sent all my skeletons away
Like everything I couldn't fix and people I couldn't change
Konstantine always tore me apart and made me cry
Now I hear that song and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that...
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine
Happiness, won't get me over this
Happiness, won't get me over anything, over anything 
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I spend my nights thinking the worst
And telling myself that everything's going to work out
I keep kicking myself in the mouth
Opening up every cut that should be a scar by now
I need the hope I always tell my friends about
I need the hope I always tell my friends about
I sleep with the TV on, it covers up my feelings about the past
Here I am lying awake thinking about how things used to be
I'm sick and tired
I'm sick and tired of being at the same old place in my head
Give me peace of mind
I always backtrack to my old self
When I'm holding on to despair and cracks in my life
I'm holding on when I need to let go
I sleep with the TV on, it covers up my feelings about the past
Here I am lying awake thinking about how things used to be
Doubt is the soil that fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
Doubt is the soil that fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
Doubt is the story of how fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
I'm dirty from head to toe
I'm dirty from head to toe
Change holds me down to the places I don't want to be
When I wake up I look in the mirror and I see
The person that's been scaring me away from moving on
And getting out of my head
I end my nights in the same spot that I told myself I would leave
I want to come home and have it be like it was before I left
I'm starting to see that I keep living alone in the past
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
I can't shake it off
Always a fight between my past,
My head, and my heart, you can cut me up
And spread me all over Illinois
I can't, I can't find myself
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
I'm stuck and I feel like I'm the only one
I end my nights in the same spot that I told myself I would leave
I want to come home and have it be like it was before I left
I'm starting to see that I keep living alone in the past
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
Did I get left behind?
Or is everybody else just hiding that they're lost
Loneliness will never leave my mind
Loneliness will never leave my mind
Did I get left behind?
Or is everybody else just hiding that they're lost
Just when I think I need someone, 
They wrap their arms around my old bones 
And I start breaking apart
I walk away from anyone that cares about me
But I swear my skin's not as rough as I make it out to be
The saddest part is I've been distant since I was sixteen
It keeps me up in bed
I'm stuck here with all the choices I've made 
And the chances I was too afraid to take
I've called myself young and stupid, 
But lately I feel old and desperate
I find it kind of weird how you find yourself 
When you have no one
I look for the right things in all the wrong places
The saddest part is I've been distant since I was sixteen
It keeps me up in bed
I'm stuck here with all the choices I've made 
And the chances I was too afraid to take
I found myself in a late night drives
Without a destination
All I had were thoughts about the past
And a list of my favorite songs to keep me company
But I still struggle and lose myself everyday
I always find myself lost in every line of all these songs
But I felt better when I saw that this is life
And in life were gonna cry
In life were gonna lose sleep
Were gonna feel helpless
But thats how its got to be 
When you lose yourself you'll find what you're looking for
I'm growing past who I used to be
As the night goes on 
I go from feeling out of place to feeling like a ghost
You miss me when I'm gone
But when I'm around it's like I'm hidden behind the paint on the walls
The loneliness will keep me warm tonight
It'll keep me warm seeing as you won't
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more than this
If the open road is my home I'm never leaving
All of the small towns make me throw away my biggest fears
And the big cities make the fucked up stuff feel smaller
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more than this
When I'm not here does anyone miss my secondhand smoke?
Do you wonder where I am or who I'm with?
Call me a mid-twenty sob story
I can't change the way I feel
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more,
Looking for something more
You were easy on my eyes
You were heavy on my heart
I never thought I'd live to see today
You're still in my mind
But not in my chest
I'm a little worn out since you fucking tore me down
You made me believe we had something
I guess that I was wrong
I thought I would be numb to this by now
I guess I was wrong
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
Stick with me or don't stick around at all
I was the boy who was too scared and ran away
I was the glue that never dried
You were the girl that made up her mind
And left me all alone to die
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
I'll sit on my basement floor
Turn off all the lights and try to not think about you
Just know that when I'm down there
I'll know that I won't be running through your mind
You were easy on my eyes
You were heavy on my heart
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
And I'll get through the winter without you
You made me believe we had something
Well I guess that I was wrong
I'm treated like an old book
That was left on the shelf
Everyone underlined what they wanted to read
And forgot the rest
My spine was left worn out and bent
So just take what you want from me
And forget the rest
It really weirds me out 
Because I never thought I'd be where I am today
My bones want to tear out of my skin
This isn't where I want to be
Getting older scares the shit out of me
I'm an old book
 

I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed

Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want
Knock me down
I'm not sure I have it in me to get back up
To be who I am seems exhausting anyway
You have a lot in common with my conscience
You both erase my confidence
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Back and forth
Between some kind of vague attachment to yesterday
And never knowing what form of myself I'll get today (to get today)
I'll always be a faded sign in your eyes
No matter what the point of view (point of view)
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
I'm not here
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want to hear
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Would you notice I'm not here
Am I telling myself the truth?
I'm used to pretending to be strong and clueless
Am I doing this right by you?
I seem to be coming off as wrong and ruthless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I changing my mind again?
All this indecision makes me shift my focus
Is the tension my only friend?
Anxiety holds my hand when life gets hopeless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I telling myself the truth about my self-esteem
And how others place their worth in me?
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
(The eyes of someone else)
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
Yeah, I'll keep smiling on the surface
(Am I telling myself the truth?)
"Smiling On The Surface" is the 3rd song released from the album "Composure". It was premiered on June 18, 2018.
Swallowing a feeling
Counting cracks across the ceiling
Never reached the depths of them before
Finding flaws in every format
I know but haven't shown that
I could pick myself up off the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Redefine rock bottom with these empty orange bottles
Never felt so paralysed before (never felt this paralysed)
We're all looking for some answers
With the hangman's broken lantern
Growing ever closer to the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Why do I, why do I, feel so damn cold?
Why am I, why am I, still so low?
Why should I, why should I, get up or get out?
Why should I?
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
Soft spoken, if ever out loud
These days not much gets out
My mind digs graves through the past
But never takes time to finish the act
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
No matter how cold it might get
My bed sheets are laced with regret
I try to fill in the lines
Rework the plans for a better design
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Here I am, bearing every burden
Here I am, showing every worry
To the world
To the world
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try
I'm at best your second option
Like a key under the mat
Are my emotions hard to read?
Seems I'm good at hiding
Reality
You disregard the consequences
Always seem to shift the blame
You burn the bridge and then I build it
Seems you're good at hiding
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
You make me feel helpless
Like a bird with broken wings
Forcing me to be more selfless
Lean on me, don't knock me over
It seems we're good at hiding
It seems we're good at fighting
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
I'm all alone
I feel sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
I'm all alone
I'm feeling sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
(There's nothing I can do)
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
Is there any chance you could cut me some slack?
Because I've been hanging for a while
From this withered rope
Forcing every sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
What could I ask that you help me hold back
Cause I've been falling for a while
Down this fucking slope
Losing any sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
There's a collage of photos framed
Dating '93 to '95
Though all it shows me is that
I'm just a bad seed
Falling off the family tree
I've got more complaints
More than pleasantries to say
Every monument is idly arranged
Every figure that has ever held importance in my life
I find nobody is who I pictured them to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the faces in reflections of the past
I feel so close but I can't reach through the glass
My life burns out and flickers like the end of a cigarette
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the light in your eyes
Turn the blind eye (Turn the blind eye)
"Why are you hurting me" she screamed from her death bed
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
It's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
The tears run down your cheekbones
I feel sorry for you
But I'm too fucking selfish to say I do
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be different
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Today I ripped myself wide open
And I saw that my heart isn't as fucked as I recalled
It's still flawed and
It's sorely stitched to my old ways
I thought it was buried, but it's just stuck
To my old ways
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be something else
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Shaking in the driver's seat
Staring at the dashboard
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
Please just stay
Please just stay
You see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
To take a chance on me
To take a chance
I still see us sitting on that old couch
'Til the sun comes up
Listening to sad songs
We spent our time with smiles on our faces
I know it sounds selfish but I'll miss those days
I know it sounds selfish
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
The Fall leaves flying through the driveway
Keep triggering these memories of you
I'm torn apart with how our lives are changing
I'm sure it sounds selfish, I'm just being honest
I know it sounds selfish
But I'm trying to be honest
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
Let's go back to when thing weren't complicated
Let's go back to all those old dashboard songs
Let's go back to smoking on the side of my old house
We can never go back, we'll never go back
We'll never go back
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
I know it sounds selfish
I'm just being honest
I can't fix everything around me
I can't make everybody happy
And it'll be okay
Show me how to be something other than nostalgic
I want to feel inspired and innocent again
I just want to be worth your time
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Lately when I'm alone I keep thinking about the past
I'm trying to feel weak in my knees again
I want to stand up straight like when I graduated
I just want to be
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Do you remember when you saw right through my selfish skin?
Do you remember when I ignored everything you did?
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
It'll be okay
We rush through our lives
Just to feel some kind of pride
Dismissing actualities is making matters worse
The ink will fade, but won't go away
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
I live in the middle of a lake
And I don't know how to swim
I've isolated everything
Everywhere I go I am consistently alone
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
Cautions only ever made me worry
You know that cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
The patience I once had is running away with my youth
Away in its hands
I've been neglecting who I am
That's just who I was back then
Don't need to be perfect, just happy
I'm still a lost boy
I'm still a lost boy
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
Every once in a while I listen to Death Cab and think about how it used to be 
We thought that we knew the answers
When no one was asking
Asking the questions 
I'm still a lost boy 
I'm still a lost boy 
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
It feels like I've been taking the long way for a while now
Haven't been at home in more years than I care to say
I keep letting my past cover what the present shouldn't be
What I shouldn't be
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
Staring out the window in my bedroom makes me think back
I see me as a boy out there
Lying in the grass
Singing songs with all the wrong notes
And graduating high school as my mom cries
I'm writing the same song over and over again
And feeling lost
I've always felt so lost
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I clenched the wheel the whole way home from Cleveland
With nothing more than my eyes half way open
And my hand smelling like smoke
Each mile I drive gets me closer to the streets that made me feel alone
I'm out of place and it doesn't feel wrong
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I care too much
While you don't even care at all
It's just sad that you don't even care
I walk up the stairs to your apartment and I feel small
The lowest feelings and even lower standards
Pictures of simple times are on the top shelf
You lie to me and say you're happy with the way things are
With the way things are
It's just sad, oh it's sad that you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I spent so much damn time trying to move forward
It hurts me to watch you falling backwards
Brave your life
Finding solutions, not making excuses
Find solutions and stop waiting for excuses
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I care too much, while you don't even care at all
A bit much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different
Don't settle because you're scared
You know I pictured things to be different
I pictured things to be different for you
For you
Could you stay here 'til I fall asleep?
We'll pretend that we could make each other feel complete
I'm looking for something that's not inside of you
Will you think of me when you drive home?
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
Last night I closed my eyes
And thought about someone that wasn't you
The weight of the world slipped off my shoulders
And weighed my back to the floor
It isn't where you want to be
I know this isn't where you want to be
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
You tell me I'm broken
As I stare out my window at the street lights
I walk outside and I sit in the shade at 3am
And I feel whole again
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
And I know we're disconnected
I'm getting pretty good at leaving, my patience isn't wearing thin
Autumn never ends in my head, no matter how far I've been
It feels like everybody is the branch and I'm the leaves
Falling from the top of every leafless tree
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
All I see is the past two years before I hit the ground
Time is moving slower on the way down (on the way down)
Save your time spent wondering what's going through my mind
Let me go before you see me following behind
I'll save you from myself
Just let me go
I'll save you from myself
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
I've learned that it's okay to be selfish
It keeps me from falling apart at the seams
Stuck is where I feel in place
A feeling I'll embrace
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
So much for bad luck
If I built a boat with apologies I've got
I'd have a sorry looking raft
It always rains
But it's nice to see
That someone else is sad
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
The coin's faced up
But I'm not feeling any better
A soap box made for every single fuck up
It's tough seeing where I am
Instead of where I'm from
My roots can get loose
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
Can you find your calling if nothing is calling for you?
I'm coughing up a lung trying to get rid of you
To get rid of you
To get rid of you
Can you find your calling
If nothing's calling for you?
For you?
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
When I heard my parents cry
I realized that we're all lost kids
Trying to find our way home
Blood is thicker than water
And I still feel like everyone I love forgot how to swim
At least there are pictures of my sister and me
Hanging on the wall in my garage
They always give me peace of mind
They always give me peace of mind
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I'm starting to see that
We're always changing
It's just so weird to think that we're always changing
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
I never spent my youth thinking of half the shit I'd go through
Living in the past never helped me
Last night I drove past the house that I grew up in
And tried to find that happiness
Living in the past never helped me
Or anyone move forward
There's no love, no growth for me here
Anymore, anymore
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I know this place is the same and that I'm changing
And I'm just
When I get stopped by a train on my drive home
I don't let it get to me like the rest of the world
I smile and think about how much I've grown over this year
It gives me time to open my mind and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that train
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine without you
I've laid to rest the shit that was always out of my hands
I finally sent all my skeletons away
Like everything I couldn't fix and people I couldn't change
Konstantine always tore me apart and made me cry
Now I hear that song and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that...
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine
Happiness, won't get me over this
Happiness, won't get me over anything, over anything 
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I spend my nights thinking the worst
And telling myself that everything's going to work out
I keep kicking myself in the mouth
Opening up every cut that should be a scar by now
I need the hope I always tell my friends about
I need the hope I always tell my friends about
I sleep with the TV on, it covers up my feelings about the past
Here I am lying awake thinking about how things used to be
I'm sick and tired
I'm sick and tired of being at the same old place in my head
Give me peace of mind
I always backtrack to my old self
When I'm holding on to despair and cracks in my life
I'm holding on when I need to let go
I sleep with the TV on, it covers up my feelings about the past
Here I am lying awake thinking about how things used to be
Doubt is the soil that fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
Doubt is the soil that fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
Doubt is the story of how fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
I'm dirty from head to toe
I'm dirty from head to toe
Change holds me down to the places I don't want to be
When I wake up I look in the mirror and I see
The person that's been scaring me away from moving on
And getting out of my head
I end my nights in the same spot that I told myself I would leave
I want to come home and have it be like it was before I left
I'm starting to see that I keep living alone in the past
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
I can't shake it off
Always a fight between my past,
My head, and my heart, you can cut me up
And spread me all over Illinois
I can't, I can't find myself
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
I'm stuck and I feel like I'm the only one
I end my nights in the same spot that I told myself I would leave
I want to come home and have it be like it was before I left
I'm starting to see that I keep living alone in the past
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
Did I get left behind?
Or is everybody else just hiding that they're lost
Loneliness will never leave my mind
Loneliness will never leave my mind
Did I get left behind?
Or is everybody else just hiding that they're lost
Just when I think I need someone, 
They wrap their arms around my old bones 
And I start breaking apart
I walk away from anyone that cares about me
But I swear my skin's not as rough as I make it out to be
The saddest part is I've been distant since I was sixteen
It keeps me up in bed
I'm stuck here with all the choices I've made 
And the chances I was too afraid to take
I've called myself young and stupid, 
But lately I feel old and desperate
I find it kind of weird how you find yourself 
When you have no one
I look for the right things in all the wrong places
The saddest part is I've been distant since I was sixteen
It keeps me up in bed
I'm stuck here with all the choices I've made 
And the chances I was too afraid to take
I found myself in a late night drives
Without a destination
All I had were thoughts about the past
And a list of my favorite songs to keep me company
But I still struggle and lose myself everyday
I always find myself lost in every line of all these songs
But I felt better when I saw that this is life
And in life were gonna cry
In life were gonna lose sleep
Were gonna feel helpless
But thats how its got to be 
When you lose yourself you'll find what you're looking for
I'm growing past who I used to be
As the night goes on 
I go from feeling out of place to feeling like a ghost
You miss me when I'm gone
But when I'm around it's like I'm hidden behind the paint on the walls
The loneliness will keep me warm tonight
It'll keep me warm seeing as you won't
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more than this
If the open road is my home I'm never leaving
All of the small towns make me throw away my biggest fears
And the big cities make the fucked up stuff feel smaller
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more than this
When I'm not here does anyone miss my secondhand smoke?
Do you wonder where I am or who I'm with?
Call me a mid-twenty sob story
I can't change the way I feel
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more,
Looking for something more
You were easy on my eyes
You were heavy on my heart
I never thought I'd live to see today
You're still in my mind
But not in my chest
I'm a little worn out since you fucking tore me down
You made me believe we had something
I guess that I was wrong
I thought I would be numb to this by now
I guess I was wrong
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
Stick with me or don't stick around at all
I was the boy who was too scared and ran away
I was the glue that never dried
You were the girl that made up her mind
And left me all alone to die
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
I'll sit on my basement floor
Turn off all the lights and try to not think about you
Just know that when I'm down there
I'll know that I won't be running through your mind
You were easy on my eyes
You were heavy on my heart
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
And I'll get through the winter without you
You made me believe we had something
Well I guess that I was wrong
I'm treated like an old book
That was left on the shelf
Everyone underlined what they wanted to read
And forgot the rest
My spine was left worn out and bent
So just take what you want from me
And forget the rest
It really weirds me out 
Because I never thought I'd be where I am today
My bones want to tear out of my skin
This isn't where I want to be
Getting older scares the shit out of me
I'm an old book
It's one of those nights where I'm scared to walk to my basement
These four walls, feel like they're caving in
There's pictures of you and me hidden behind my couch
I'll be waiting for the sun to shine through my window well
Am I trying to forget you or just cover you up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
I used to have an escape
But I ripped the map up a long time ago
So I'll lie to myself and say that I don't care at all
You'll always be hidden in the basement of everything I love
Am I trying to forget you or just cover you up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
The only time that I feel fine
Is when I'm parked in front of my house with tears in my eyes
I find comfort in weakness because it's always there for me
You'll always be hidden in the basement
Of everything I love
Are you trying to forget me or did you cover me up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
 

I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm

I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want
Knock me down
I'm not sure I have it in me to get back up
To be who I am seems exhausting anyway
You have a lot in common with my conscience
You both erase my confidence
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Back and forth
Between some kind of vague attachment to yesterday
And never knowing what form of myself I'll get today (to get today)
I'll always be a faded sign in your eyes
No matter what the point of view (point of view)
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
I'm not here
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want to hear
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Would you notice I'm not here
Am I telling myself the truth?
I'm used to pretending to be strong and clueless
Am I doing this right by you?
I seem to be coming off as wrong and ruthless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I changing my mind again?
All this indecision makes me shift my focus
Is the tension my only friend?
Anxiety holds my hand when life gets hopeless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I telling myself the truth about my self-esteem
And how others place their worth in me?
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
(The eyes of someone else)
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
Yeah, I'll keep smiling on the surface
(Am I telling myself the truth?)
"Smiling On The Surface" is the 3rd song released from the album "Composure". It was premiered on June 18, 2018.
Swallowing a feeling
Counting cracks across the ceiling
Never reached the depths of them before
Finding flaws in every format
I know but haven't shown that
I could pick myself up off the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Redefine rock bottom with these empty orange bottles
Never felt so paralysed before (never felt this paralysed)
We're all looking for some answers
With the hangman's broken lantern
Growing ever closer to the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Why do I, why do I, feel so damn cold?
Why am I, why am I, still so low?
Why should I, why should I, get up or get out?
Why should I?
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
Soft spoken, if ever out loud
These days not much gets out
My mind digs graves through the past
But never takes time to finish the act
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
No matter how cold it might get
My bed sheets are laced with regret
I try to fill in the lines
Rework the plans for a better design
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Here I am, bearing every burden
Here I am, showing every worry
To the world
To the world
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try
I'm at best your second option
Like a key under the mat
Are my emotions hard to read?
Seems I'm good at hiding
Reality
You disregard the consequences
Always seem to shift the blame
You burn the bridge and then I build it
Seems you're good at hiding
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
You make me feel helpless
Like a bird with broken wings
Forcing me to be more selfless
Lean on me, don't knock me over
It seems we're good at hiding
It seems we're good at fighting
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
I'm all alone
I feel sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
I'm all alone
I'm feeling sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
(There's nothing I can do)
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
Is there any chance you could cut me some slack?
Because I've been hanging for a while
From this withered rope
Forcing every sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
What could I ask that you help me hold back
Cause I've been falling for a while
Down this fucking slope
Losing any sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
There's a collage of photos framed
Dating '93 to '95
Though all it shows me is that
I'm just a bad seed
Falling off the family tree
I've got more complaints
More than pleasantries to say
Every monument is idly arranged
Every figure that has ever held importance in my life
I find nobody is who I pictured them to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the faces in reflections of the past
I feel so close but I can't reach through the glass
My life burns out and flickers like the end of a cigarette
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the light in your eyes
Turn the blind eye (Turn the blind eye)
"Why are you hurting me" she screamed from her death bed
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
It's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
The tears run down your cheekbones
I feel sorry for you
But I'm too fucking selfish to say I do
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be different
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Today I ripped myself wide open
And I saw that my heart isn't as fucked as I recalled
It's still flawed and
It's sorely stitched to my old ways
I thought it was buried, but it's just stuck
To my old ways
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be something else
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Shaking in the driver's seat
Staring at the dashboard
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
Please just stay
Please just stay
You see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
To take a chance on me
To take a chance
I still see us sitting on that old couch
'Til the sun comes up
Listening to sad songs
We spent our time with smiles on our faces
I know it sounds selfish but I'll miss those days
I know it sounds selfish
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
The Fall leaves flying through the driveway
Keep triggering these memories of you
I'm torn apart with how our lives are changing
I'm sure it sounds selfish, I'm just being honest
I know it sounds selfish
But I'm trying to be honest
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
Let's go back to when thing weren't complicated
Let's go back to all those old dashboard songs
Let's go back to smoking on the side of my old house
We can never go back, we'll never go back
We'll never go back
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
I know it sounds selfish
I'm just being honest
I can't fix everything around me
I can't make everybody happy
And it'll be okay
Show me how to be something other than nostalgic
I want to feel inspired and innocent again
I just want to be worth your time
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Lately when I'm alone I keep thinking about the past
I'm trying to feel weak in my knees again
I want to stand up straight like when I graduated
I just want to be
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Do you remember when you saw right through my selfish skin?
Do you remember when I ignored everything you did?
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
It'll be okay
We rush through our lives
Just to feel some kind of pride
Dismissing actualities is making matters worse
The ink will fade, but won't go away
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
I live in the middle of a lake
And I don't know how to swim
I've isolated everything
Everywhere I go I am consistently alone
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
Cautions only ever made me worry
You know that cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
The patience I once had is running away with my youth
Away in its hands
I've been neglecting who I am
That's just who I was back then
Don't need to be perfect, just happy
I'm still a lost boy
I'm still a lost boy
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
Every once in a while I listen to Death Cab and think about how it used to be 
We thought that we knew the answers
When no one was asking
Asking the questions 
I'm still a lost boy 
I'm still a lost boy 
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
It feels like I've been taking the long way for a while now
Haven't been at home in more years than I care to say
I keep letting my past cover what the present shouldn't be
What I shouldn't be
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
Staring out the window in my bedroom makes me think back
I see me as a boy out there
Lying in the grass
Singing songs with all the wrong notes
And graduating high school as my mom cries
I'm writing the same song over and over again
And feeling lost
I've always felt so lost
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I clenched the wheel the whole way home from Cleveland
With nothing more than my eyes half way open
And my hand smelling like smoke
Each mile I drive gets me closer to the streets that made me feel alone
I'm out of place and it doesn't feel wrong
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I care too much
While you don't even care at all
It's just sad that you don't even care
I walk up the stairs to your apartment and I feel small
The lowest feelings and even lower standards
Pictures of simple times are on the top shelf
You lie to me and say you're happy with the way things are
With the way things are
It's just sad, oh it's sad that you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I spent so much damn time trying to move forward
It hurts me to watch you falling backwards
Brave your life
Finding solutions, not making excuses
Find solutions and stop waiting for excuses
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I care too much, while you don't even care at all
A bit much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different
Don't settle because you're scared
You know I pictured things to be different
I pictured things to be different for you
For you
Could you stay here 'til I fall asleep?
We'll pretend that we could make each other feel complete
I'm looking for something that's not inside of you
Will you think of me when you drive home?
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
Last night I closed my eyes
And thought about someone that wasn't you
The weight of the world slipped off my shoulders
And weighed my back to the floor
It isn't where you want to be
I know this isn't where you want to be
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
You tell me I'm broken
As I stare out my window at the street lights
I walk outside and I sit in the shade at 3am
And I feel whole again
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
And I know we're disconnected
I'm getting pretty good at leaving, my patience isn't wearing thin
Autumn never ends in my head, no matter how far I've been
It feels like everybody is the branch and I'm the leaves
Falling from the top of every leafless tree
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
All I see is the past two years before I hit the ground
Time is moving slower on the way down (on the way down)
Save your time spent wondering what's going through my mind
Let me go before you see me following behind
I'll save you from myself
Just let me go
I'll save you from myself
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
I've learned that it's okay to be selfish
It keeps me from falling apart at the seams
Stuck is where I feel in place
A feeling I'll embrace
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
So much for bad luck
If I built a boat with apologies I've got
I'd have a sorry looking raft
It always rains
But it's nice to see
That someone else is sad
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
The coin's faced up
But I'm not feeling any better
A soap box made for every single fuck up
It's tough seeing where I am
Instead of where I'm from
My roots can get loose
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
Can you find your calling if nothing is calling for you?
I'm coughing up a lung trying to get rid of you
To get rid of you
To get rid of you
Can you find your calling
If nothing's calling for you?
For you?
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
When I heard my parents cry
I realized that we're all lost kids
Trying to find our way home
Blood is thicker than water
And I still feel like everyone I love forgot how to swim
At least there are pictures of my sister and me
Hanging on the wall in my garage
They always give me peace of mind
They always give me peace of mind
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I'm starting to see that
We're always changing
It's just so weird to think that we're always changing
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
I never spent my youth thinking of half the shit I'd go through
Living in the past never helped me
Last night I drove past the house that I grew up in
And tried to find that happiness
Living in the past never helped me
Or anyone move forward
There's no love, no growth for me here
Anymore, anymore
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I know this place is the same and that I'm changing
And I'm just
When I get stopped by a train on my drive home
I don't let it get to me like the rest of the world
I smile and think about how much I've grown over this year
It gives me time to open my mind and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that train
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine without you
I've laid to rest the shit that was always out of my hands
I finally sent all my skeletons away
Like everything I couldn't fix and people I couldn't change
Konstantine always tore me apart and made me cry
Now I hear that song and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that...
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine
Happiness, won't get me over this
Happiness, won't get me over anything, over anything 
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I spend my nights thinking the worst
And telling myself that everything's going to work out
I keep kicking myself in the mouth
Opening up every cut that should be a scar by now
I need the hope I always tell my friends about
I need the hope I always tell my friends about
I sleep with the TV on, it covers up my feelings about the past
Here I am lying awake thinking about how things used to be
I'm sick and tired
I'm sick and tired of being at the same old place in my head
Give me peace of mind
I always backtrack to my old self
When I'm holding on to despair and cracks in my life
I'm holding on when I need to let go
I sleep with the TV on, it covers up my feelings about the past
Here I am lying awake thinking about how things used to be
Doubt is the soil that fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
Doubt is the soil that fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
Doubt is the story of how fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
I'm dirty from head to toe
I'm dirty from head to toe
Change holds me down to the places I don't want to be
When I wake up I look in the mirror and I see
The person that's been scaring me away from moving on
And getting out of my head
I end my nights in the same spot that I told myself I would leave
I want to come home and have it be like it was before I left
I'm starting to see that I keep living alone in the past
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
I can't shake it off
Always a fight between my past,
My head, and my heart, you can cut me up
And spread me all over Illinois
I can't, I can't find myself
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
I'm stuck and I feel like I'm the only one
I end my nights in the same spot that I told myself I would leave
I want to come home and have it be like it was before I left
I'm starting to see that I keep living alone in the past
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
Did I get left behind?
Or is everybody else just hiding that they're lost
Loneliness will never leave my mind
Loneliness will never leave my mind
Did I get left behind?
Or is everybody else just hiding that they're lost
Just when I think I need someone, 
They wrap their arms around my old bones 
And I start breaking apart
I walk away from anyone that cares about me
But I swear my skin's not as rough as I make it out to be
The saddest part is I've been distant since I was sixteen
It keeps me up in bed
I'm stuck here with all the choices I've made 
And the chances I was too afraid to take
I've called myself young and stupid, 
But lately I feel old and desperate
I find it kind of weird how you find yourself 
When you have no one
I look for the right things in all the wrong places
The saddest part is I've been distant since I was sixteen
It keeps me up in bed
I'm stuck here with all the choices I've made 
And the chances I was too afraid to take
I found myself in a late night drives
Without a destination
All I had were thoughts about the past
And a list of my favorite songs to keep me company
But I still struggle and lose myself everyday
I always find myself lost in every line of all these songs
But I felt better when I saw that this is life
And in life were gonna cry
In life were gonna lose sleep
Were gonna feel helpless
But thats how its got to be 
When you lose yourself you'll find what you're looking for
I'm growing past who I used to be
As the night goes on 
I go from feeling out of place to feeling like a ghost
You miss me when I'm gone
But when I'm around it's like I'm hidden behind the paint on the walls
The loneliness will keep me warm tonight
It'll keep me warm seeing as you won't
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more than this
If the open road is my home I'm never leaving
All of the small towns make me throw away my biggest fears
And the big cities make the fucked up stuff feel smaller
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more than this
When I'm not here does anyone miss my secondhand smoke?
Do you wonder where I am or who I'm with?
Call me a mid-twenty sob story
I can't change the way I feel
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more,
Looking for something more
You were easy on my eyes
You were heavy on my heart
I never thought I'd live to see today
You're still in my mind
But not in my chest
I'm a little worn out since you fucking tore me down
You made me believe we had something
I guess that I was wrong
I thought I would be numb to this by now
I guess I was wrong
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
Stick with me or don't stick around at all
I was the boy who was too scared and ran away
I was the glue that never dried
You were the girl that made up her mind
And left me all alone to die
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
I'll sit on my basement floor
Turn off all the lights and try to not think about you
Just know that when I'm down there
I'll know that I won't be running through your mind
You were easy on my eyes
You were heavy on my heart
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
And I'll get through the winter without you
You made me believe we had something
Well I guess that I was wrong
I'm treated like an old book
That was left on the shelf
Everyone underlined what they wanted to read
And forgot the rest
My spine was left worn out and bent
So just take what you want from me
And forget the rest
It really weirds me out 
Because I never thought I'd be where I am today
My bones want to tear out of my skin
This isn't where I want to be
Getting older scares the shit out of me
I'm an old book
It's one of those nights where I'm scared to walk to my basement
These four walls, feel like they're caving in
There's pictures of you and me hidden behind my couch
I'll be waiting for the sun to shine through my window well
Am I trying to forget you or just cover you up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
I used to have an escape
But I ripped the map up a long time ago
So I'll lie to myself and say that I don't care at all
You'll always be hidden in the basement of everything I love
Am I trying to forget you or just cover you up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
The only time that I feel fine
Is when I'm parked in front of my house with tears in my eyes
I find comfort in weakness because it's always there for me
You'll always be hidden in the basement
Of everything I love
Are you trying to forget me or did you cover me up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
I can't believe you've got the nerve to say you love me
Then you left me for dead
I don't love you anymore
I hope you're happy since I don't know you anymore
You were a part of me 
And now you're just nothing but a memory
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
Now I'm just like the pictures that you take
I'm nothing but something that once was
Like colors that fade away in the sunlight
They're nothing special like they used to be
They're gone and they're never coming back
No, they're never coming back
I'm gone and I'm never coming back
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
I woke up today and realized that what we had is dead
I'm just a pile of lifeless bones to you
I've spent too many years thinking about somebody 
That doesn't even think about me
Thinking about somebody that doesn't even think about me
Thinking about somebody That doesn't even think about... 
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
 

I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go

"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want
Knock me down
I'm not sure I have it in me to get back up
To be who I am seems exhausting anyway
You have a lot in common with my conscience
You both erase my confidence
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Back and forth
Between some kind of vague attachment to yesterday
And never knowing what form of myself I'll get today (to get today)
I'll always be a faded sign in your eyes
No matter what the point of view (point of view)
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
I'm not here
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want to hear
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Would you notice I'm not here
Am I telling myself the truth?
I'm used to pretending to be strong and clueless
Am I doing this right by you?
I seem to be coming off as wrong and ruthless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I changing my mind again?
All this indecision makes me shift my focus
Is the tension my only friend?
Anxiety holds my hand when life gets hopeless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I telling myself the truth about my self-esteem
And how others place their worth in me?
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
(The eyes of someone else)
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
Yeah, I'll keep smiling on the surface
(Am I telling myself the truth?)
"Smiling On The Surface" is the 3rd song released from the album "Composure". It was premiered on June 18, 2018.
Swallowing a feeling
Counting cracks across the ceiling
Never reached the depths of them before
Finding flaws in every format
I know but haven't shown that
I could pick myself up off the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Redefine rock bottom with these empty orange bottles
Never felt so paralysed before (never felt this paralysed)
We're all looking for some answers
With the hangman's broken lantern
Growing ever closer to the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Why do I, why do I, feel so damn cold?
Why am I, why am I, still so low?
Why should I, why should I, get up or get out?
Why should I?
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
Soft spoken, if ever out loud
These days not much gets out
My mind digs graves through the past
But never takes time to finish the act
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
No matter how cold it might get
My bed sheets are laced with regret
I try to fill in the lines
Rework the plans for a better design
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Here I am, bearing every burden
Here I am, showing every worry
To the world
To the world
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try
I'm at best your second option
Like a key under the mat
Are my emotions hard to read?
Seems I'm good at hiding
Reality
You disregard the consequences
Always seem to shift the blame
You burn the bridge and then I build it
Seems you're good at hiding
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
You make me feel helpless
Like a bird with broken wings
Forcing me to be more selfless
Lean on me, don't knock me over
It seems we're good at hiding
It seems we're good at fighting
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
I'm all alone
I feel sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
I'm all alone
I'm feeling sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
(There's nothing I can do)
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
Is there any chance you could cut me some slack?
Because I've been hanging for a while
From this withered rope
Forcing every sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
What could I ask that you help me hold back
Cause I've been falling for a while
Down this fucking slope
Losing any sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
There's a collage of photos framed
Dating '93 to '95
Though all it shows me is that
I'm just a bad seed
Falling off the family tree
I've got more complaints
More than pleasantries to say
Every monument is idly arranged
Every figure that has ever held importance in my life
I find nobody is who I pictured them to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the faces in reflections of the past
I feel so close but I can't reach through the glass
My life burns out and flickers like the end of a cigarette
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the light in your eyes
Turn the blind eye (Turn the blind eye)
"Why are you hurting me" she screamed from her death bed
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
It's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
The tears run down your cheekbones
I feel sorry for you
But I'm too fucking selfish to say I do
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be different
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Today I ripped myself wide open
And I saw that my heart isn't as fucked as I recalled
It's still flawed and
It's sorely stitched to my old ways
I thought it was buried, but it's just stuck
To my old ways
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be something else
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Shaking in the driver's seat
Staring at the dashboard
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
Please just stay
Please just stay
You see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
To take a chance on me
To take a chance
I still see us sitting on that old couch
'Til the sun comes up
Listening to sad songs
We spent our time with smiles on our faces
I know it sounds selfish but I'll miss those days
I know it sounds selfish
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
The Fall leaves flying through the driveway
Keep triggering these memories of you
I'm torn apart with how our lives are changing
I'm sure it sounds selfish, I'm just being honest
I know it sounds selfish
But I'm trying to be honest
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
Let's go back to when thing weren't complicated
Let's go back to all those old dashboard songs
Let's go back to smoking on the side of my old house
We can never go back, we'll never go back
We'll never go back
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
I know it sounds selfish
I'm just being honest
I can't fix everything around me
I can't make everybody happy
And it'll be okay
Show me how to be something other than nostalgic
I want to feel inspired and innocent again
I just want to be worth your time
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Lately when I'm alone I keep thinking about the past
I'm trying to feel weak in my knees again
I want to stand up straight like when I graduated
I just want to be
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Do you remember when you saw right through my selfish skin?
Do you remember when I ignored everything you did?
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
It'll be okay
We rush through our lives
Just to feel some kind of pride
Dismissing actualities is making matters worse
The ink will fade, but won't go away
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
I live in the middle of a lake
And I don't know how to swim
I've isolated everything
Everywhere I go I am consistently alone
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
Cautions only ever made me worry
You know that cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
The patience I once had is running away with my youth
Away in its hands
I've been neglecting who I am
That's just who I was back then
Don't need to be perfect, just happy
I'm still a lost boy
I'm still a lost boy
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
Every once in a while I listen to Death Cab and think about how it used to be 
We thought that we knew the answers
When no one was asking
Asking the questions 
I'm still a lost boy 
I'm still a lost boy 
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
It feels like I've been taking the long way for a while now
Haven't been at home in more years than I care to say
I keep letting my past cover what the present shouldn't be
What I shouldn't be
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
Staring out the window in my bedroom makes me think back
I see me as a boy out there
Lying in the grass
Singing songs with all the wrong notes
And graduating high school as my mom cries
I'm writing the same song over and over again
And feeling lost
I've always felt so lost
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I clenched the wheel the whole way home from Cleveland
With nothing more than my eyes half way open
And my hand smelling like smoke
Each mile I drive gets me closer to the streets that made me feel alone
I'm out of place and it doesn't feel wrong
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I care too much
While you don't even care at all
It's just sad that you don't even care
I walk up the stairs to your apartment and I feel small
The lowest feelings and even lower standards
Pictures of simple times are on the top shelf
You lie to me and say you're happy with the way things are
With the way things are
It's just sad, oh it's sad that you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I spent so much damn time trying to move forward
It hurts me to watch you falling backwards
Brave your life
Finding solutions, not making excuses
Find solutions and stop waiting for excuses
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I care too much, while you don't even care at all
A bit much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different
Don't settle because you're scared
You know I pictured things to be different
I pictured things to be different for you
For you
Could you stay here 'til I fall asleep?
We'll pretend that we could make each other feel complete
I'm looking for something that's not inside of you
Will you think of me when you drive home?
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
Last night I closed my eyes
And thought about someone that wasn't you
The weight of the world slipped off my shoulders
And weighed my back to the floor
It isn't where you want to be
I know this isn't where you want to be
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
You tell me I'm broken
As I stare out my window at the street lights
I walk outside and I sit in the shade at 3am
And I feel whole again
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
And I know we're disconnected
I'm getting pretty good at leaving, my patience isn't wearing thin
Autumn never ends in my head, no matter how far I've been
It feels like everybody is the branch and I'm the leaves
Falling from the top of every leafless tree
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
All I see is the past two years before I hit the ground
Time is moving slower on the way down (on the way down)
Save your time spent wondering what's going through my mind
Let me go before you see me following behind
I'll save you from myself
Just let me go
I'll save you from myself
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
I've learned that it's okay to be selfish
It keeps me from falling apart at the seams
Stuck is where I feel in place
A feeling I'll embrace
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
So much for bad luck
If I built a boat with apologies I've got
I'd have a sorry looking raft
It always rains
But it's nice to see
That someone else is sad
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
The coin's faced up
But I'm not feeling any better
A soap box made for every single fuck up
It's tough seeing where I am
Instead of where I'm from
My roots can get loose
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
Can you find your calling if nothing is calling for you?
I'm coughing up a lung trying to get rid of you
To get rid of you
To get rid of you
Can you find your calling
If nothing's calling for you?
For you?
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
When I heard my parents cry
I realized that we're all lost kids
Trying to find our way home
Blood is thicker than water
And I still feel like everyone I love forgot how to swim
At least there are pictures of my sister and me
Hanging on the wall in my garage
They always give me peace of mind
They always give me peace of mind
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I'm starting to see that
We're always changing
It's just so weird to think that we're always changing
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
I never spent my youth thinking of half the shit I'd go through
Living in the past never helped me
Last night I drove past the house that I grew up in
And tried to find that happiness
Living in the past never helped me
Or anyone move forward
There's no love, no growth for me here
Anymore, anymore
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I know this place is the same and that I'm changing
And I'm just
When I get stopped by a train on my drive home
I don't let it get to me like the rest of the world
I smile and think about how much I've grown over this year
It gives me time to open my mind and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that train
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine without you
I've laid to rest the shit that was always out of my hands
I finally sent all my skeletons away
Like everything I couldn't fix and people I couldn't change
Konstantine always tore me apart and made me cry
Now I hear that song and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that...
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine
Happiness, won't get me over this
Happiness, won't get me over anything, over anything 
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I spend my nights thinking the worst
And telling myself that everything's going to work out
I keep kicking myself in the mouth
Opening up every cut that should be a scar by now
I need the hope I always tell my friends about
I need the hope I always tell my friends about
I sleep with the TV on, it covers up my feelings about the past
Here I am lying awake thinking about how things used to be
I'm sick and tired
I'm sick and tired of being at the same old place in my head
Give me peace of mind
I always backtrack to my old self
When I'm holding on to despair and cracks in my life
I'm holding on when I need to let go
I sleep with the TV on, it covers up my feelings about the past
Here I am lying awake thinking about how things used to be
Doubt is the soil that fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
Doubt is the soil that fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
Doubt is the story of how fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
I'm dirty from head to toe
I'm dirty from head to toe
Change holds me down to the places I don't want to be
When I wake up I look in the mirror and I see
The person that's been scaring me away from moving on
And getting out of my head
I end my nights in the same spot that I told myself I would leave
I want to come home and have it be like it was before I left
I'm starting to see that I keep living alone in the past
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
I can't shake it off
Always a fight between my past,
My head, and my heart, you can cut me up
And spread me all over Illinois
I can't, I can't find myself
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
I'm stuck and I feel like I'm the only one
I end my nights in the same spot that I told myself I would leave
I want to come home and have it be like it was before I left
I'm starting to see that I keep living alone in the past
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
Did I get left behind?
Or is everybody else just hiding that they're lost
Loneliness will never leave my mind
Loneliness will never leave my mind
Did I get left behind?
Or is everybody else just hiding that they're lost
Just when I think I need someone, 
They wrap their arms around my old bones 
And I start breaking apart
I walk away from anyone that cares about me
But I swear my skin's not as rough as I make it out to be
The saddest part is I've been distant since I was sixteen
It keeps me up in bed
I'm stuck here with all the choices I've made 
And the chances I was too afraid to take
I've called myself young and stupid, 
But lately I feel old and desperate
I find it kind of weird how you find yourself 
When you have no one
I look for the right things in all the wrong places
The saddest part is I've been distant since I was sixteen
It keeps me up in bed
I'm stuck here with all the choices I've made 
And the chances I was too afraid to take
I found myself in a late night drives
Without a destination
All I had were thoughts about the past
And a list of my favorite songs to keep me company
But I still struggle and lose myself everyday
I always find myself lost in every line of all these songs
But I felt better when I saw that this is life
And in life were gonna cry
In life were gonna lose sleep
Were gonna feel helpless
But thats how its got to be 
When you lose yourself you'll find what you're looking for
I'm growing past who I used to be
As the night goes on 
I go from feeling out of place to feeling like a ghost
You miss me when I'm gone
But when I'm around it's like I'm hidden behind the paint on the walls
The loneliness will keep me warm tonight
It'll keep me warm seeing as you won't
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more than this
If the open road is my home I'm never leaving
All of the small towns make me throw away my biggest fears
And the big cities make the fucked up stuff feel smaller
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more than this
When I'm not here does anyone miss my secondhand smoke?
Do you wonder where I am or who I'm with?
Call me a mid-twenty sob story
I can't change the way I feel
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more,
Looking for something more
You were easy on my eyes
You were heavy on my heart
I never thought I'd live to see today
You're still in my mind
But not in my chest
I'm a little worn out since you fucking tore me down
You made me believe we had something
I guess that I was wrong
I thought I would be numb to this by now
I guess I was wrong
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
Stick with me or don't stick around at all
I was the boy who was too scared and ran away
I was the glue that never dried
You were the girl that made up her mind
And left me all alone to die
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
I'll sit on my basement floor
Turn off all the lights and try to not think about you
Just know that when I'm down there
I'll know that I won't be running through your mind
You were easy on my eyes
You were heavy on my heart
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
And I'll get through the winter without you
You made me believe we had something
Well I guess that I was wrong
I'm treated like an old book
That was left on the shelf
Everyone underlined what they wanted to read
And forgot the rest
My spine was left worn out and bent
So just take what you want from me
And forget the rest
It really weirds me out 
Because I never thought I'd be where I am today
My bones want to tear out of my skin
This isn't where I want to be
Getting older scares the shit out of me
I'm an old book
It's one of those nights where I'm scared to walk to my basement
These four walls, feel like they're caving in
There's pictures of you and me hidden behind my couch
I'll be waiting for the sun to shine through my window well
Am I trying to forget you or just cover you up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
I used to have an escape
But I ripped the map up a long time ago
So I'll lie to myself and say that I don't care at all
You'll always be hidden in the basement of everything I love
Am I trying to forget you or just cover you up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
The only time that I feel fine
Is when I'm parked in front of my house with tears in my eyes
I find comfort in weakness because it's always there for me
You'll always be hidden in the basement
Of everything I love
Are you trying to forget me or did you cover me up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
I can't believe you've got the nerve to say you love me
Then you left me for dead
I don't love you anymore
I hope you're happy since I don't know you anymore
You were a part of me 
And now you're just nothing but a memory
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
Now I'm just like the pictures that you take
I'm nothing but something that once was
Like colors that fade away in the sunlight
They're nothing special like they used to be
They're gone and they're never coming back
No, they're never coming back
I'm gone and I'm never coming back
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
I woke up today and realized that what we had is dead
I'm just a pile of lifeless bones to you
I've spent too many years thinking about somebody 
That doesn't even think about me
Thinking about somebody that doesn't even think about me
Thinking about somebody That doesn't even think about... 
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
Maybe this place is the same...
And we're just changing
Maybe this place is the same...
And we're just changing
 

I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more

"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want
Knock me down
I'm not sure I have it in me to get back up
To be who I am seems exhausting anyway
You have a lot in common with my conscience
You both erase my confidence
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Back and forth
Between some kind of vague attachment to yesterday
And never knowing what form of myself I'll get today (to get today)
I'll always be a faded sign in your eyes
No matter what the point of view (point of view)
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
I'm not here
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want to hear
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Would you notice I'm not here
Am I telling myself the truth?
I'm used to pretending to be strong and clueless
Am I doing this right by you?
I seem to be coming off as wrong and ruthless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I changing my mind again?
All this indecision makes me shift my focus
Is the tension my only friend?
Anxiety holds my hand when life gets hopeless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I telling myself the truth about my self-esteem
And how others place their worth in me?
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
(The eyes of someone else)
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
Yeah, I'll keep smiling on the surface
(Am I telling myself the truth?)
"Smiling On The Surface" is the 3rd song released from the album "Composure". It was premiered on June 18, 2018.
Swallowing a feeling
Counting cracks across the ceiling
Never reached the depths of them before
Finding flaws in every format
I know but haven't shown that
I could pick myself up off the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Redefine rock bottom with these empty orange bottles
Never felt so paralysed before (never felt this paralysed)
We're all looking for some answers
With the hangman's broken lantern
Growing ever closer to the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Why do I, why do I, feel so damn cold?
Why am I, why am I, still so low?
Why should I, why should I, get up or get out?
Why should I?
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
Soft spoken, if ever out loud
These days not much gets out
My mind digs graves through the past
But never takes time to finish the act
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
No matter how cold it might get
My bed sheets are laced with regret
I try to fill in the lines
Rework the plans for a better design
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Here I am, bearing every burden
Here I am, showing every worry
To the world
To the world
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try
I'm at best your second option
Like a key under the mat
Are my emotions hard to read?
Seems I'm good at hiding
Reality
You disregard the consequences
Always seem to shift the blame
You burn the bridge and then I build it
Seems you're good at hiding
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
You make me feel helpless
Like a bird with broken wings
Forcing me to be more selfless
Lean on me, don't knock me over
It seems we're good at hiding
It seems we're good at fighting
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
I'm all alone
I feel sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
I'm all alone
I'm feeling sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
(There's nothing I can do)
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
Is there any chance you could cut me some slack?
Because I've been hanging for a while
From this withered rope
Forcing every sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
What could I ask that you help me hold back
Cause I've been falling for a while
Down this fucking slope
Losing any sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
There's a collage of photos framed
Dating '93 to '95
Though all it shows me is that
I'm just a bad seed
Falling off the family tree
I've got more complaints
More than pleasantries to say
Every monument is idly arranged
Every figure that has ever held importance in my life
I find nobody is who I pictured them to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the faces in reflections of the past
I feel so close but I can't reach through the glass
My life burns out and flickers like the end of a cigarette
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the light in your eyes
Turn the blind eye (Turn the blind eye)
"Why are you hurting me" she screamed from her death bed
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
It's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
The tears run down your cheekbones
I feel sorry for you
But I'm too fucking selfish to say I do
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be different
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Today I ripped myself wide open
And I saw that my heart isn't as fucked as I recalled
It's still flawed and
It's sorely stitched to my old ways
I thought it was buried, but it's just stuck
To my old ways
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be something else
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Shaking in the driver's seat
Staring at the dashboard
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
Please just stay
Please just stay
You see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
To take a chance on me
To take a chance
I still see us sitting on that old couch
'Til the sun comes up
Listening to sad songs
We spent our time with smiles on our faces
I know it sounds selfish but I'll miss those days
I know it sounds selfish
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
The Fall leaves flying through the driveway
Keep triggering these memories of you
I'm torn apart with how our lives are changing
I'm sure it sounds selfish, I'm just being honest
I know it sounds selfish
But I'm trying to be honest
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
Let's go back to when thing weren't complicated
Let's go back to all those old dashboard songs
Let's go back to smoking on the side of my old house
We can never go back, we'll never go back
We'll never go back
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
I know it sounds selfish
I'm just being honest
I can't fix everything around me
I can't make everybody happy
And it'll be okay
Show me how to be something other than nostalgic
I want to feel inspired and innocent again
I just want to be worth your time
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Lately when I'm alone I keep thinking about the past
I'm trying to feel weak in my knees again
I want to stand up straight like when I graduated
I just want to be
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Do you remember when you saw right through my selfish skin?
Do you remember when I ignored everything you did?
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
It'll be okay
We rush through our lives
Just to feel some kind of pride
Dismissing actualities is making matters worse
The ink will fade, but won't go away
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
I live in the middle of a lake
And I don't know how to swim
I've isolated everything
Everywhere I go I am consistently alone
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
Cautions only ever made me worry
You know that cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
The patience I once had is running away with my youth
Away in its hands
I've been neglecting who I am
That's just who I was back then
Don't need to be perfect, just happy
I'm still a lost boy
I'm still a lost boy
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
Every once in a while I listen to Death Cab and think about how it used to be 
We thought that we knew the answers
When no one was asking
Asking the questions 
I'm still a lost boy 
I'm still a lost boy 
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
It feels like I've been taking the long way for a while now
Haven't been at home in more years than I care to say
I keep letting my past cover what the present shouldn't be
What I shouldn't be
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
Staring out the window in my bedroom makes me think back
I see me as a boy out there
Lying in the grass
Singing songs with all the wrong notes
And graduating high school as my mom cries
I'm writing the same song over and over again
And feeling lost
I've always felt so lost
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I clenched the wheel the whole way home from Cleveland
With nothing more than my eyes half way open
And my hand smelling like smoke
Each mile I drive gets me closer to the streets that made me feel alone
I'm out of place and it doesn't feel wrong
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I care too much
While you don't even care at all
It's just sad that you don't even care
I walk up the stairs to your apartment and I feel small
The lowest feelings and even lower standards
Pictures of simple times are on the top shelf
You lie to me and say you're happy with the way things are
With the way things are
It's just sad, oh it's sad that you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I spent so much damn time trying to move forward
It hurts me to watch you falling backwards
Brave your life
Finding solutions, not making excuses
Find solutions and stop waiting for excuses
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I care too much, while you don't even care at all
A bit much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different
Don't settle because you're scared
You know I pictured things to be different
I pictured things to be different for you
For you
Could you stay here 'til I fall asleep?
We'll pretend that we could make each other feel complete
I'm looking for something that's not inside of you
Will you think of me when you drive home?
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
Last night I closed my eyes
And thought about someone that wasn't you
The weight of the world slipped off my shoulders
And weighed my back to the floor
It isn't where you want to be
I know this isn't where you want to be
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
You tell me I'm broken
As I stare out my window at the street lights
I walk outside and I sit in the shade at 3am
And I feel whole again
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
And I know we're disconnected
I'm getting pretty good at leaving, my patience isn't wearing thin
Autumn never ends in my head, no matter how far I've been
It feels like everybody is the branch and I'm the leaves
Falling from the top of every leafless tree
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
All I see is the past two years before I hit the ground
Time is moving slower on the way down (on the way down)
Save your time spent wondering what's going through my mind
Let me go before you see me following behind
I'll save you from myself
Just let me go
I'll save you from myself
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
I've learned that it's okay to be selfish
It keeps me from falling apart at the seams
Stuck is where I feel in place
A feeling I'll embrace
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
So much for bad luck
If I built a boat with apologies I've got
I'd have a sorry looking raft
It always rains
But it's nice to see
That someone else is sad
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
The coin's faced up
But I'm not feeling any better
A soap box made for every single fuck up
It's tough seeing where I am
Instead of where I'm from
My roots can get loose
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
Can you find your calling if nothing is calling for you?
I'm coughing up a lung trying to get rid of you
To get rid of you
To get rid of you
Can you find your calling
If nothing's calling for you?
For you?
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
When I heard my parents cry
I realized that we're all lost kids
Trying to find our way home
Blood is thicker than water
And I still feel like everyone I love forgot how to swim
At least there are pictures of my sister and me
Hanging on the wall in my garage
They always give me peace of mind
They always give me peace of mind
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I'm starting to see that
We're always changing
It's just so weird to think that we're always changing
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
I never spent my youth thinking of half the shit I'd go through
Living in the past never helped me
Last night I drove past the house that I grew up in
And tried to find that happiness
Living in the past never helped me
Or anyone move forward
There's no love, no growth for me here
Anymore, anymore
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I know this place is the same and that I'm changing
And I'm just
When I get stopped by a train on my drive home
I don't let it get to me like the rest of the world
I smile and think about how much I've grown over this year
It gives me time to open my mind and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that train
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine without you
I've laid to rest the shit that was always out of my hands
I finally sent all my skeletons away
Like everything I couldn't fix and people I couldn't change
Konstantine always tore me apart and made me cry
Now I hear that song and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that...
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine
Happiness, won't get me over this
Happiness, won't get me over anything, over anything 
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I spend my nights thinking the worst
And telling myself that everything's going to work out
I keep kicking myself in the mouth
Opening up every cut that should be a scar by now
I need the hope I always tell my friends about
I need the hope I always tell my friends about
I sleep with the TV on, it covers up my feelings about the past
Here I am lying awake thinking about how things used to be
I'm sick and tired
I'm sick and tired of being at the same old place in my head
Give me peace of mind
I always backtrack to my old self
When I'm holding on to despair and cracks in my life
I'm holding on when I need to let go
I sleep with the TV on, it covers up my feelings about the past
Here I am lying awake thinking about how things used to be
Doubt is the soil that fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
Doubt is the soil that fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
Doubt is the story of how fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
I'm dirty from head to toe
I'm dirty from head to toe
Change holds me down to the places I don't want to be
When I wake up I look in the mirror and I see
The person that's been scaring me away from moving on
And getting out of my head
I end my nights in the same spot that I told myself I would leave
I want to come home and have it be like it was before I left
I'm starting to see that I keep living alone in the past
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
I can't shake it off
Always a fight between my past,
My head, and my heart, you can cut me up
And spread me all over Illinois
I can't, I can't find myself
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
I'm stuck and I feel like I'm the only one
I end my nights in the same spot that I told myself I would leave
I want to come home and have it be like it was before I left
I'm starting to see that I keep living alone in the past
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
Did I get left behind?
Or is everybody else just hiding that they're lost
Loneliness will never leave my mind
Loneliness will never leave my mind
Did I get left behind?
Or is everybody else just hiding that they're lost
Just when I think I need someone, 
They wrap their arms around my old bones 
And I start breaking apart
I walk away from anyone that cares about me
But I swear my skin's not as rough as I make it out to be
The saddest part is I've been distant since I was sixteen
It keeps me up in bed
I'm stuck here with all the choices I've made 
And the chances I was too afraid to take
I've called myself young and stupid, 
But lately I feel old and desperate
I find it kind of weird how you find yourself 
When you have no one
I look for the right things in all the wrong places
The saddest part is I've been distant since I was sixteen
It keeps me up in bed
I'm stuck here with all the choices I've made 
And the chances I was too afraid to take
I found myself in a late night drives
Without a destination
All I had were thoughts about the past
And a list of my favorite songs to keep me company
But I still struggle and lose myself everyday
I always find myself lost in every line of all these songs
But I felt better when I saw that this is life
And in life were gonna cry
In life were gonna lose sleep
Were gonna feel helpless
But thats how its got to be 
When you lose yourself you'll find what you're looking for
I'm growing past who I used to be
As the night goes on 
I go from feeling out of place to feeling like a ghost
You miss me when I'm gone
But when I'm around it's like I'm hidden behind the paint on the walls
The loneliness will keep me warm tonight
It'll keep me warm seeing as you won't
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more than this
If the open road is my home I'm never leaving
All of the small towns make me throw away my biggest fears
And the big cities make the fucked up stuff feel smaller
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more than this
When I'm not here does anyone miss my secondhand smoke?
Do you wonder where I am or who I'm with?
Call me a mid-twenty sob story
I can't change the way I feel
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more,
Looking for something more
You were easy on my eyes
You were heavy on my heart
I never thought I'd live to see today
You're still in my mind
But not in my chest
I'm a little worn out since you fucking tore me down
You made me believe we had something
I guess that I was wrong
I thought I would be numb to this by now
I guess I was wrong
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
Stick with me or don't stick around at all
I was the boy who was too scared and ran away
I was the glue that never dried
You were the girl that made up her mind
And left me all alone to die
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
I'll sit on my basement floor
Turn off all the lights and try to not think about you
Just know that when I'm down there
I'll know that I won't be running through your mind
You were easy on my eyes
You were heavy on my heart
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
And I'll get through the winter without you
You made me believe we had something
Well I guess that I was wrong
I'm treated like an old book
That was left on the shelf
Everyone underlined what they wanted to read
And forgot the rest
My spine was left worn out and bent
So just take what you want from me
And forget the rest
It really weirds me out 
Because I never thought I'd be where I am today
My bones want to tear out of my skin
This isn't where I want to be
Getting older scares the shit out of me
I'm an old book
It's one of those nights where I'm scared to walk to my basement
These four walls, feel like they're caving in
There's pictures of you and me hidden behind my couch
I'll be waiting for the sun to shine through my window well
Am I trying to forget you or just cover you up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
I used to have an escape
But I ripped the map up a long time ago
So I'll lie to myself and say that I don't care at all
You'll always be hidden in the basement of everything I love
Am I trying to forget you or just cover you up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
The only time that I feel fine
Is when I'm parked in front of my house with tears in my eyes
I find comfort in weakness because it's always there for me
You'll always be hidden in the basement
Of everything I love
Are you trying to forget me or did you cover me up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
I can't believe you've got the nerve to say you love me
Then you left me for dead
I don't love you anymore
I hope you're happy since I don't know you anymore
You were a part of me 
And now you're just nothing but a memory
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
Now I'm just like the pictures that you take
I'm nothing but something that once was
Like colors that fade away in the sunlight
They're nothing special like they used to be
They're gone and they're never coming back
No, they're never coming back
I'm gone and I'm never coming back
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
I woke up today and realized that what we had is dead
I'm just a pile of lifeless bones to you
I've spent too many years thinking about somebody 
That doesn't even think about me
Thinking about somebody that doesn't even think about me
Thinking about somebody That doesn't even think about... 
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
Maybe this place is the same...
And we're just changing
Maybe this place is the same...
And we're just changing
I'm driving on state lines pretending you're standing there
But I know your feet will never be where my eyes fall again
Moving on is something I've always had trouble with
But this year I swear I'll get past it
If I had a backyard I would bury all my memories of you in it
Everything that we had would die right down in the dirt
I wish I had the guts to say this to your face
But the past five years took everything I had and ripped it out of me
You used to make me feel like I was something
Now you make me feel like absolutely nothing
I want to fall asleep and wake up four years ago
We were just kids who didn't know what love was
Or what we were digging ourselves into
I want to know if you ever hear 
All of these sad fucking songs I write about you
I wish I had the guts to say this to your face
But the past five years took everything I had and ripped it out of me
You used to make me feel like I was something
Now you make me feel like absolutely nothing
I know you probably hate who I've become
I'm just young and stupid, 
But that's the way I always want to be
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
 

I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure

But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away

"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want
Knock me down
I'm not sure I have it in me to get back up
To be who I am seems exhausting anyway
You have a lot in common with my conscience
You both erase my confidence
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Back and forth
Between some kind of vague attachment to yesterday
And never knowing what form of myself I'll get today (to get today)
I'll always be a faded sign in your eyes
No matter what the point of view (point of view)
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
I'm not here
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want to hear
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Would you notice I'm not here
Am I telling myself the truth?
I'm used to pretending to be strong and clueless
Am I doing this right by you?
I seem to be coming off as wrong and ruthless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I changing my mind again?
All this indecision makes me shift my focus
Is the tension my only friend?
Anxiety holds my hand when life gets hopeless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I telling myself the truth about my self-esteem
And how others place their worth in me?
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
(The eyes of someone else)
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
Yeah, I'll keep smiling on the surface
(Am I telling myself the truth?)
"Smiling On The Surface" is the 3rd song released from the album "Composure". It was premiered on June 18, 2018.
Swallowing a feeling
Counting cracks across the ceiling
Never reached the depths of them before
Finding flaws in every format
I know but haven't shown that
I could pick myself up off the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Redefine rock bottom with these empty orange bottles
Never felt so paralysed before (never felt this paralysed)
We're all looking for some answers
With the hangman's broken lantern
Growing ever closer to the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Why do I, why do I, feel so damn cold?
Why am I, why am I, still so low?
Why should I, why should I, get up or get out?
Why should I?
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
Soft spoken, if ever out loud
These days not much gets out
My mind digs graves through the past
But never takes time to finish the act
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
No matter how cold it might get
My bed sheets are laced with regret
I try to fill in the lines
Rework the plans for a better design
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Here I am, bearing every burden
Here I am, showing every worry
To the world
To the world
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try
I'm at best your second option
Like a key under the mat
Are my emotions hard to read?
Seems I'm good at hiding
Reality
You disregard the consequences
Always seem to shift the blame
You burn the bridge and then I build it
Seems you're good at hiding
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
You make me feel helpless
Like a bird with broken wings
Forcing me to be more selfless
Lean on me, don't knock me over
It seems we're good at hiding
It seems we're good at fighting
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
I'm all alone
I feel sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
I'm all alone
I'm feeling sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
(There's nothing I can do)
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
Is there any chance you could cut me some slack?
Because I've been hanging for a while
From this withered rope
Forcing every sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
What could I ask that you help me hold back
Cause I've been falling for a while
Down this fucking slope
Losing any sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
There's a collage of photos framed
Dating '93 to '95
Though all it shows me is that
I'm just a bad seed
Falling off the family tree
I've got more complaints
More than pleasantries to say
Every monument is idly arranged
Every figure that has ever held importance in my life
I find nobody is who I pictured them to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the faces in reflections of the past
I feel so close but I can't reach through the glass
My life burns out and flickers like the end of a cigarette
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the light in your eyes
Turn the blind eye (Turn the blind eye)
"Why are you hurting me" she screamed from her death bed
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
It's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
The tears run down your cheekbones
I feel sorry for you
But I'm too fucking selfish to say I do
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be different
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Today I ripped myself wide open
And I saw that my heart isn't as fucked as I recalled
It's still flawed and
It's sorely stitched to my old ways
I thought it was buried, but it's just stuck
To my old ways
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be something else
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Shaking in the driver's seat
Staring at the dashboard
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
Please just stay
Please just stay
You see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
To take a chance on me
To take a chance
I still see us sitting on that old couch
'Til the sun comes up
Listening to sad songs
We spent our time with smiles on our faces
I know it sounds selfish but I'll miss those days
I know it sounds selfish
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
The Fall leaves flying through the driveway
Keep triggering these memories of you
I'm torn apart with how our lives are changing
I'm sure it sounds selfish, I'm just being honest
I know it sounds selfish
But I'm trying to be honest
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
Let's go back to when thing weren't complicated
Let's go back to all those old dashboard songs
Let's go back to smoking on the side of my old house
We can never go back, we'll never go back
We'll never go back
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
I know it sounds selfish
I'm just being honest
I can't fix everything around me
I can't make everybody happy
And it'll be okay
Show me how to be something other than nostalgic
I want to feel inspired and innocent again
I just want to be worth your time
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Lately when I'm alone I keep thinking about the past
I'm trying to feel weak in my knees again
I want to stand up straight like when I graduated
I just want to be
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Do you remember when you saw right through my selfish skin?
Do you remember when I ignored everything you did?
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
It'll be okay
We rush through our lives
Just to feel some kind of pride
Dismissing actualities is making matters worse
The ink will fade, but won't go away
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
I live in the middle of a lake
And I don't know how to swim
I've isolated everything
Everywhere I go I am consistently alone
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
Cautions only ever made me worry
You know that cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
The patience I once had is running away with my youth
Away in its hands
I've been neglecting who I am
That's just who I was back then
Don't need to be perfect, just happy
I'm still a lost boy
I'm still a lost boy
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
Every once in a while I listen to Death Cab and think about how it used to be 
We thought that we knew the answers
When no one was asking
Asking the questions 
I'm still a lost boy 
I'm still a lost boy 
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
It feels like I've been taking the long way for a while now
Haven't been at home in more years than I care to say
I keep letting my past cover what the present shouldn't be
What I shouldn't be
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
Staring out the window in my bedroom makes me think back
I see me as a boy out there
Lying in the grass
Singing songs with all the wrong notes
And graduating high school as my mom cries
I'm writing the same song over and over again
And feeling lost
I've always felt so lost
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I clenched the wheel the whole way home from Cleveland
With nothing more than my eyes half way open
And my hand smelling like smoke
Each mile I drive gets me closer to the streets that made me feel alone
I'm out of place and it doesn't feel wrong
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I care too much
While you don't even care at all
It's just sad that you don't even care
I walk up the stairs to your apartment and I feel small
The lowest feelings and even lower standards
Pictures of simple times are on the top shelf
You lie to me and say you're happy with the way things are
With the way things are
It's just sad, oh it's sad that you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I spent so much damn time trying to move forward
It hurts me to watch you falling backwards
Brave your life
Finding solutions, not making excuses
Find solutions and stop waiting for excuses
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I care too much, while you don't even care at all
A bit much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different
Don't settle because you're scared
You know I pictured things to be different
I pictured things to be different for you
For you
Could you stay here 'til I fall asleep?
We'll pretend that we could make each other feel complete
I'm looking for something that's not inside of you
Will you think of me when you drive home?
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
Last night I closed my eyes
And thought about someone that wasn't you
The weight of the world slipped off my shoulders
And weighed my back to the floor
It isn't where you want to be
I know this isn't where you want to be
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
You tell me I'm broken
As I stare out my window at the street lights
I walk outside and I sit in the shade at 3am
And I feel whole again
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
And I know we're disconnected
I'm getting pretty good at leaving, my patience isn't wearing thin
Autumn never ends in my head, no matter how far I've been
It feels like everybody is the branch and I'm the leaves
Falling from the top of every leafless tree
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
All I see is the past two years before I hit the ground
Time is moving slower on the way down (on the way down)
Save your time spent wondering what's going through my mind
Let me go before you see me following behind
I'll save you from myself
Just let me go
I'll save you from myself
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
I've learned that it's okay to be selfish
It keeps me from falling apart at the seams
Stuck is where I feel in place
A feeling I'll embrace
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
So much for bad luck
If I built a boat with apologies I've got
I'd have a sorry looking raft
It always rains
But it's nice to see
That someone else is sad
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
The coin's faced up
But I'm not feeling any better
A soap box made for every single fuck up
It's tough seeing where I am
Instead of where I'm from
My roots can get loose
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
Can you find your calling if nothing is calling for you?
I'm coughing up a lung trying to get rid of you
To get rid of you
To get rid of you
Can you find your calling
If nothing's calling for you?
For you?
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
When I heard my parents cry
I realized that we're all lost kids
Trying to find our way home
Blood is thicker than water
And I still feel like everyone I love forgot how to swim
At least there are pictures of my sister and me
Hanging on the wall in my garage
They always give me peace of mind
They always give me peace of mind
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I'm starting to see that
We're always changing
It's just so weird to think that we're always changing
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
I never spent my youth thinking of half the shit I'd go through
Living in the past never helped me
Last night I drove past the house that I grew up in
And tried to find that happiness
Living in the past never helped me
Or anyone move forward
There's no love, no growth for me here
Anymore, anymore
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I know this place is the same and that I'm changing
And I'm just
When I get stopped by a train on my drive home
I don't let it get to me like the rest of the world
I smile and think about how much I've grown over this year
It gives me time to open my mind and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that train
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine without you
I've laid to rest the shit that was always out of my hands
I finally sent all my skeletons away
Like everything I couldn't fix and people I couldn't change
Konstantine always tore me apart and made me cry
Now I hear that song and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that...
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine
Happiness, won't get me over this
Happiness, won't get me over anything, over anything 
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I spend my nights thinking the worst
And telling myself that everything's going to work out
I keep kicking myself in the mouth
Opening up every cut that should be a scar by now
I need the hope I always tell my friends about
I need the hope I always tell my friends about
I sleep with the TV on, it covers up my feelings about the past
Here I am lying awake thinking about how things used to be
I'm sick and tired
I'm sick and tired of being at the same old place in my head
Give me peace of mind
I always backtrack to my old self
When I'm holding on to despair and cracks in my life
I'm holding on when I need to let go
I sleep with the TV on, it covers up my feelings about the past
Here I am lying awake thinking about how things used to be
Doubt is the soil that fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
Doubt is the soil that fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
Doubt is the story of how fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
I'm dirty from head to toe
I'm dirty from head to toe
Change holds me down to the places I don't want to be
When I wake up I look in the mirror and I see
The person that's been scaring me away from moving on
And getting out of my head
I end my nights in the same spot that I told myself I would leave
I want to come home and have it be like it was before I left
I'm starting to see that I keep living alone in the past
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
I can't shake it off
Always a fight between my past,
My head, and my heart, you can cut me up
And spread me all over Illinois
I can't, I can't find myself
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
I'm stuck and I feel like I'm the only one
I end my nights in the same spot that I told myself I would leave
I want to come home and have it be like it was before I left
I'm starting to see that I keep living alone in the past
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
Did I get left behind?
Or is everybody else just hiding that they're lost
Loneliness will never leave my mind
Loneliness will never leave my mind
Did I get left behind?
Or is everybody else just hiding that they're lost
Just when I think I need someone, 
They wrap their arms around my old bones 
And I start breaking apart
I walk away from anyone that cares about me
But I swear my skin's not as rough as I make it out to be
The saddest part is I've been distant since I was sixteen
It keeps me up in bed
I'm stuck here with all the choices I've made 
And the chances I was too afraid to take
I've called myself young and stupid, 
But lately I feel old and desperate
I find it kind of weird how you find yourself 
When you have no one
I look for the right things in all the wrong places
The saddest part is I've been distant since I was sixteen
It keeps me up in bed
I'm stuck here with all the choices I've made 
And the chances I was too afraid to take
I found myself in a late night drives
Without a destination
All I had were thoughts about the past
And a list of my favorite songs to keep me company
But I still struggle and lose myself everyday
I always find myself lost in every line of all these songs
But I felt better when I saw that this is life
And in life were gonna cry
In life were gonna lose sleep
Were gonna feel helpless
But thats how its got to be 
When you lose yourself you'll find what you're looking for
I'm growing past who I used to be
As the night goes on 
I go from feeling out of place to feeling like a ghost
You miss me when I'm gone
But when I'm around it's like I'm hidden behind the paint on the walls
The loneliness will keep me warm tonight
It'll keep me warm seeing as you won't
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more than this
If the open road is my home I'm never leaving
All of the small towns make me throw away my biggest fears
And the big cities make the fucked up stuff feel smaller
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more than this
When I'm not here does anyone miss my secondhand smoke?
Do you wonder where I am or who I'm with?
Call me a mid-twenty sob story
I can't change the way I feel
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more,
Looking for something more
You were easy on my eyes
You were heavy on my heart
I never thought I'd live to see today
You're still in my mind
But not in my chest
I'm a little worn out since you fucking tore me down
You made me believe we had something
I guess that I was wrong
I thought I would be numb to this by now
I guess I was wrong
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
Stick with me or don't stick around at all
I was the boy who was too scared and ran away
I was the glue that never dried
You were the girl that made up her mind
And left me all alone to die
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
I'll sit on my basement floor
Turn off all the lights and try to not think about you
Just know that when I'm down there
I'll know that I won't be running through your mind
You were easy on my eyes
You were heavy on my heart
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
And I'll get through the winter without you
You made me believe we had something
Well I guess that I was wrong
I'm treated like an old book
That was left on the shelf
Everyone underlined what they wanted to read
And forgot the rest
My spine was left worn out and bent
So just take what you want from me
And forget the rest
It really weirds me out 
Because I never thought I'd be where I am today
My bones want to tear out of my skin
This isn't where I want to be
Getting older scares the shit out of me
I'm an old book
It's one of those nights where I'm scared to walk to my basement
These four walls, feel like they're caving in
There's pictures of you and me hidden behind my couch
I'll be waiting for the sun to shine through my window well
Am I trying to forget you or just cover you up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
I used to have an escape
But I ripped the map up a long time ago
So I'll lie to myself and say that I don't care at all
You'll always be hidden in the basement of everything I love
Am I trying to forget you or just cover you up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
The only time that I feel fine
Is when I'm parked in front of my house with tears in my eyes
I find comfort in weakness because it's always there for me
You'll always be hidden in the basement
Of everything I love
Are you trying to forget me or did you cover me up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
I can't believe you've got the nerve to say you love me
Then you left me for dead
I don't love you anymore
I hope you're happy since I don't know you anymore
You were a part of me 
And now you're just nothing but a memory
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
Now I'm just like the pictures that you take
I'm nothing but something that once was
Like colors that fade away in the sunlight
They're nothing special like they used to be
They're gone and they're never coming back
No, they're never coming back
I'm gone and I'm never coming back
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
I woke up today and realized that what we had is dead
I'm just a pile of lifeless bones to you
I've spent too many years thinking about somebody 
That doesn't even think about me
Thinking about somebody that doesn't even think about me
Thinking about somebody That doesn't even think about... 
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
Maybe this place is the same...
And we're just changing
Maybe this place is the same...
And we're just changing
I'm driving on state lines pretending you're standing there
But I know your feet will never be where my eyes fall again
Moving on is something I've always had trouble with
But this year I swear I'll get past it
If I had a backyard I would bury all my memories of you in it
Everything that we had would die right down in the dirt
I wish I had the guts to say this to your face
But the past five years took everything I had and ripped it out of me
You used to make me feel like I was something
Now you make me feel like absolutely nothing
I want to fall asleep and wake up four years ago
We were just kids who didn't know what love was
Or what we were digging ourselves into
I want to know if you ever hear 
All of these sad fucking songs I write about you
I wish I had the guts to say this to your face
But the past five years took everything I had and ripped it out of me
You used to make me feel like I was something
Now you make me feel like absolutely nothing
I know you probably hate who I've become
I'm just young and stupid, 
But that's the way I always want to be
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone 
You wouldn't know a good thing even if it slapped the makeup right off of your face
Burn down the bridges just in time for last call
Keep digging yourself neck deep into selfishness
I doubt that you'll ever find out who you really are
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone
Keep falling over that same fucking step on your front porch
Most people learn from their mistakes
But you'll just stay here tripping on the same mistakes
You always do
No one's knocked you off your feet, they say what you want to hear
You're living proof that we don't always get what we deserve
But you're really nothing special
Just another crack in the sidewalk
You never meant anything to me
Or anyone for more than one night
No one's gonna stick around for when you're broken down and blacked out
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone
Keep falling over that same fucking step on your front porch
Most people learn from their mistakes
But you'll just stay here tripping on the same mistakes
You always do
Throw away your early twenties giving up on everyone and everything around you
It never came so easy
Throw away your early twenties giving up on everyone and everything around you
It never came so easy
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone
Keep falling over that same fucking step on your front porch
Most people learn from their mistakes
But you'll just stay here tripping on the same mistakes
You always do
 

I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out

But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm

My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want
Knock me down
I'm not sure I have it in me to get back up
To be who I am seems exhausting anyway
You have a lot in common with my conscience
You both erase my confidence
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Back and forth
Between some kind of vague attachment to yesterday
And never knowing what form of myself I'll get today (to get today)
I'll always be a faded sign in your eyes
No matter what the point of view (point of view)
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
I'm not here
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want to hear
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Would you notice I'm not here
Am I telling myself the truth?
I'm used to pretending to be strong and clueless
Am I doing this right by you?
I seem to be coming off as wrong and ruthless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I changing my mind again?
All this indecision makes me shift my focus
Is the tension my only friend?
Anxiety holds my hand when life gets hopeless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I telling myself the truth about my self-esteem
And how others place their worth in me?
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
(The eyes of someone else)
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
Yeah, I'll keep smiling on the surface
(Am I telling myself the truth?)
"Smiling On The Surface" is the 3rd song released from the album "Composure". It was premiered on June 18, 2018.
Swallowing a feeling
Counting cracks across the ceiling
Never reached the depths of them before
Finding flaws in every format
I know but haven't shown that
I could pick myself up off the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Redefine rock bottom with these empty orange bottles
Never felt so paralysed before (never felt this paralysed)
We're all looking for some answers
With the hangman's broken lantern
Growing ever closer to the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Why do I, why do I, feel so damn cold?
Why am I, why am I, still so low?
Why should I, why should I, get up or get out?
Why should I?
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
Soft spoken, if ever out loud
These days not much gets out
My mind digs graves through the past
But never takes time to finish the act
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
No matter how cold it might get
My bed sheets are laced with regret
I try to fill in the lines
Rework the plans for a better design
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Here I am, bearing every burden
Here I am, showing every worry
To the world
To the world
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try
I'm at best your second option
Like a key under the mat
Are my emotions hard to read?
Seems I'm good at hiding
Reality
You disregard the consequences
Always seem to shift the blame
You burn the bridge and then I build it
Seems you're good at hiding
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
You make me feel helpless
Like a bird with broken wings
Forcing me to be more selfless
Lean on me, don't knock me over
It seems we're good at hiding
It seems we're good at fighting
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
I'm all alone
I feel sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
I'm all alone
I'm feeling sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
(There's nothing I can do)
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
Is there any chance you could cut me some slack?
Because I've been hanging for a while
From this withered rope
Forcing every sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
What could I ask that you help me hold back
Cause I've been falling for a while
Down this fucking slope
Losing any sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
There's a collage of photos framed
Dating '93 to '95
Though all it shows me is that
I'm just a bad seed
Falling off the family tree
I've got more complaints
More than pleasantries to say
Every monument is idly arranged
Every figure that has ever held importance in my life
I find nobody is who I pictured them to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the faces in reflections of the past
I feel so close but I can't reach through the glass
My life burns out and flickers like the end of a cigarette
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the light in your eyes
Turn the blind eye (Turn the blind eye)
"Why are you hurting me" she screamed from her death bed
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
It's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
The tears run down your cheekbones
I feel sorry for you
But I'm too fucking selfish to say I do
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be different
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Today I ripped myself wide open
And I saw that my heart isn't as fucked as I recalled
It's still flawed and
It's sorely stitched to my old ways
I thought it was buried, but it's just stuck
To my old ways
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be something else
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Shaking in the driver's seat
Staring at the dashboard
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
Please just stay
Please just stay
You see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
To take a chance on me
To take a chance
I still see us sitting on that old couch
'Til the sun comes up
Listening to sad songs
We spent our time with smiles on our faces
I know it sounds selfish but I'll miss those days
I know it sounds selfish
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
The Fall leaves flying through the driveway
Keep triggering these memories of you
I'm torn apart with how our lives are changing
I'm sure it sounds selfish, I'm just being honest
I know it sounds selfish
But I'm trying to be honest
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
Let's go back to when thing weren't complicated
Let's go back to all those old dashboard songs
Let's go back to smoking on the side of my old house
We can never go back, we'll never go back
We'll never go back
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
I know it sounds selfish
I'm just being honest
I can't fix everything around me
I can't make everybody happy
And it'll be okay
Show me how to be something other than nostalgic
I want to feel inspired and innocent again
I just want to be worth your time
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Lately when I'm alone I keep thinking about the past
I'm trying to feel weak in my knees again
I want to stand up straight like when I graduated
I just want to be
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Do you remember when you saw right through my selfish skin?
Do you remember when I ignored everything you did?
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
It'll be okay
We rush through our lives
Just to feel some kind of pride
Dismissing actualities is making matters worse
The ink will fade, but won't go away
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
I live in the middle of a lake
And I don't know how to swim
I've isolated everything
Everywhere I go I am consistently alone
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
Cautions only ever made me worry
You know that cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
The patience I once had is running away with my youth
Away in its hands
I've been neglecting who I am
That's just who I was back then
Don't need to be perfect, just happy
I'm still a lost boy
I'm still a lost boy
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
Every once in a while I listen to Death Cab and think about how it used to be 
We thought that we knew the answers
When no one was asking
Asking the questions 
I'm still a lost boy 
I'm still a lost boy 
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
It feels like I've been taking the long way for a while now
Haven't been at home in more years than I care to say
I keep letting my past cover what the present shouldn't be
What I shouldn't be
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
Staring out the window in my bedroom makes me think back
I see me as a boy out there
Lying in the grass
Singing songs with all the wrong notes
And graduating high school as my mom cries
I'm writing the same song over and over again
And feeling lost
I've always felt so lost
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I clenched the wheel the whole way home from Cleveland
With nothing more than my eyes half way open
And my hand smelling like smoke
Each mile I drive gets me closer to the streets that made me feel alone
I'm out of place and it doesn't feel wrong
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I care too much
While you don't even care at all
It's just sad that you don't even care
I walk up the stairs to your apartment and I feel small
The lowest feelings and even lower standards
Pictures of simple times are on the top shelf
You lie to me and say you're happy with the way things are
With the way things are
It's just sad, oh it's sad that you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I spent so much damn time trying to move forward
It hurts me to watch you falling backwards
Brave your life
Finding solutions, not making excuses
Find solutions and stop waiting for excuses
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I care too much, while you don't even care at all
A bit much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different
Don't settle because you're scared
You know I pictured things to be different
I pictured things to be different for you
For you
Could you stay here 'til I fall asleep?
We'll pretend that we could make each other feel complete
I'm looking for something that's not inside of you
Will you think of me when you drive home?
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
Last night I closed my eyes
And thought about someone that wasn't you
The weight of the world slipped off my shoulders
And weighed my back to the floor
It isn't where you want to be
I know this isn't where you want to be
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
You tell me I'm broken
As I stare out my window at the street lights
I walk outside and I sit in the shade at 3am
And I feel whole again
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
And I know we're disconnected
I'm getting pretty good at leaving, my patience isn't wearing thin
Autumn never ends in my head, no matter how far I've been
It feels like everybody is the branch and I'm the leaves
Falling from the top of every leafless tree
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
All I see is the past two years before I hit the ground
Time is moving slower on the way down (on the way down)
Save your time spent wondering what's going through my mind
Let me go before you see me following behind
I'll save you from myself
Just let me go
I'll save you from myself
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
I've learned that it's okay to be selfish
It keeps me from falling apart at the seams
Stuck is where I feel in place
A feeling I'll embrace
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
So much for bad luck
If I built a boat with apologies I've got
I'd have a sorry looking raft
It always rains
But it's nice to see
That someone else is sad
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
The coin's faced up
But I'm not feeling any better
A soap box made for every single fuck up
It's tough seeing where I am
Instead of where I'm from
My roots can get loose
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
Can you find your calling if nothing is calling for you?
I'm coughing up a lung trying to get rid of you
To get rid of you
To get rid of you
Can you find your calling
If nothing's calling for you?
For you?
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
When I heard my parents cry
I realized that we're all lost kids
Trying to find our way home
Blood is thicker than water
And I still feel like everyone I love forgot how to swim
At least there are pictures of my sister and me
Hanging on the wall in my garage
They always give me peace of mind
They always give me peace of mind
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I'm starting to see that
We're always changing
It's just so weird to think that we're always changing
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
I never spent my youth thinking of half the shit I'd go through
Living in the past never helped me
Last night I drove past the house that I grew up in
And tried to find that happiness
Living in the past never helped me
Or anyone move forward
There's no love, no growth for me here
Anymore, anymore
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I know this place is the same and that I'm changing
And I'm just
When I get stopped by a train on my drive home
I don't let it get to me like the rest of the world
I smile and think about how much I've grown over this year
It gives me time to open my mind and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that train
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine without you
I've laid to rest the shit that was always out of my hands
I finally sent all my skeletons away
Like everything I couldn't fix and people I couldn't change
Konstantine always tore me apart and made me cry
Now I hear that song and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that...
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine
Happiness, won't get me over this
Happiness, won't get me over anything, over anything 
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I spend my nights thinking the worst
And telling myself that everything's going to work out
I keep kicking myself in the mouth
Opening up every cut that should be a scar by now
I need the hope I always tell my friends about
I need the hope I always tell my friends about
I sleep with the TV on, it covers up my feelings about the past
Here I am lying awake thinking about how things used to be
I'm sick and tired
I'm sick and tired of being at the same old place in my head
Give me peace of mind
I always backtrack to my old self
When I'm holding on to despair and cracks in my life
I'm holding on when I need to let go
I sleep with the TV on, it covers up my feelings about the past
Here I am lying awake thinking about how things used to be
Doubt is the soil that fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
Doubt is the soil that fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
Doubt is the story of how fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
I'm dirty from head to toe
I'm dirty from head to toe
Change holds me down to the places I don't want to be
When I wake up I look in the mirror and I see
The person that's been scaring me away from moving on
And getting out of my head
I end my nights in the same spot that I told myself I would leave
I want to come home and have it be like it was before I left
I'm starting to see that I keep living alone in the past
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
I can't shake it off
Always a fight between my past,
My head, and my heart, you can cut me up
And spread me all over Illinois
I can't, I can't find myself
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
I'm stuck and I feel like I'm the only one
I end my nights in the same spot that I told myself I would leave
I want to come home and have it be like it was before I left
I'm starting to see that I keep living alone in the past
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
Did I get left behind?
Or is everybody else just hiding that they're lost
Loneliness will never leave my mind
Loneliness will never leave my mind
Did I get left behind?
Or is everybody else just hiding that they're lost
Just when I think I need someone, 
They wrap their arms around my old bones 
And I start breaking apart
I walk away from anyone that cares about me
But I swear my skin's not as rough as I make it out to be
The saddest part is I've been distant since I was sixteen
It keeps me up in bed
I'm stuck here with all the choices I've made 
And the chances I was too afraid to take
I've called myself young and stupid, 
But lately I feel old and desperate
I find it kind of weird how you find yourself 
When you have no one
I look for the right things in all the wrong places
The saddest part is I've been distant since I was sixteen
It keeps me up in bed
I'm stuck here with all the choices I've made 
And the chances I was too afraid to take
I found myself in a late night drives
Without a destination
All I had were thoughts about the past
And a list of my favorite songs to keep me company
But I still struggle and lose myself everyday
I always find myself lost in every line of all these songs
But I felt better when I saw that this is life
And in life were gonna cry
In life were gonna lose sleep
Were gonna feel helpless
But thats how its got to be 
When you lose yourself you'll find what you're looking for
I'm growing past who I used to be
As the night goes on 
I go from feeling out of place to feeling like a ghost
You miss me when I'm gone
But when I'm around it's like I'm hidden behind the paint on the walls
The loneliness will keep me warm tonight
It'll keep me warm seeing as you won't
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more than this
If the open road is my home I'm never leaving
All of the small towns make me throw away my biggest fears
And the big cities make the fucked up stuff feel smaller
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more than this
When I'm not here does anyone miss my secondhand smoke?
Do you wonder where I am or who I'm with?
Call me a mid-twenty sob story
I can't change the way I feel
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more,
Looking for something more
You were easy on my eyes
You were heavy on my heart
I never thought I'd live to see today
You're still in my mind
But not in my chest
I'm a little worn out since you fucking tore me down
You made me believe we had something
I guess that I was wrong
I thought I would be numb to this by now
I guess I was wrong
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
Stick with me or don't stick around at all
I was the boy who was too scared and ran away
I was the glue that never dried
You were the girl that made up her mind
And left me all alone to die
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
I'll sit on my basement floor
Turn off all the lights and try to not think about you
Just know that when I'm down there
I'll know that I won't be running through your mind
You were easy on my eyes
You were heavy on my heart
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
And I'll get through the winter without you
You made me believe we had something
Well I guess that I was wrong
I'm treated like an old book
That was left on the shelf
Everyone underlined what they wanted to read
And forgot the rest
My spine was left worn out and bent
So just take what you want from me
And forget the rest
It really weirds me out 
Because I never thought I'd be where I am today
My bones want to tear out of my skin
This isn't where I want to be
Getting older scares the shit out of me
I'm an old book
It's one of those nights where I'm scared to walk to my basement
These four walls, feel like they're caving in
There's pictures of you and me hidden behind my couch
I'll be waiting for the sun to shine through my window well
Am I trying to forget you or just cover you up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
I used to have an escape
But I ripped the map up a long time ago
So I'll lie to myself and say that I don't care at all
You'll always be hidden in the basement of everything I love
Am I trying to forget you or just cover you up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
The only time that I feel fine
Is when I'm parked in front of my house with tears in my eyes
I find comfort in weakness because it's always there for me
You'll always be hidden in the basement
Of everything I love
Are you trying to forget me or did you cover me up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
I can't believe you've got the nerve to say you love me
Then you left me for dead
I don't love you anymore
I hope you're happy since I don't know you anymore
You were a part of me 
And now you're just nothing but a memory
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
Now I'm just like the pictures that you take
I'm nothing but something that once was
Like colors that fade away in the sunlight
They're nothing special like they used to be
They're gone and they're never coming back
No, they're never coming back
I'm gone and I'm never coming back
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
I woke up today and realized that what we had is dead
I'm just a pile of lifeless bones to you
I've spent too many years thinking about somebody 
That doesn't even think about me
Thinking about somebody that doesn't even think about me
Thinking about somebody That doesn't even think about... 
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
Maybe this place is the same...
And we're just changing
Maybe this place is the same...
And we're just changing
I'm driving on state lines pretending you're standing there
But I know your feet will never be where my eyes fall again
Moving on is something I've always had trouble with
But this year I swear I'll get past it
If I had a backyard I would bury all my memories of you in it
Everything that we had would die right down in the dirt
I wish I had the guts to say this to your face
But the past five years took everything I had and ripped it out of me
You used to make me feel like I was something
Now you make me feel like absolutely nothing
I want to fall asleep and wake up four years ago
We were just kids who didn't know what love was
Or what we were digging ourselves into
I want to know if you ever hear 
All of these sad fucking songs I write about you
I wish I had the guts to say this to your face
But the past five years took everything I had and ripped it out of me
You used to make me feel like I was something
Now you make me feel like absolutely nothing
I know you probably hate who I've become
I'm just young and stupid, 
But that's the way I always want to be
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone 
You wouldn't know a good thing even if it slapped the makeup right off of your face
Burn down the bridges just in time for last call
Keep digging yourself neck deep into selfishness
I doubt that you'll ever find out who you really are
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone
Keep falling over that same fucking step on your front porch
Most people learn from their mistakes
But you'll just stay here tripping on the same mistakes
You always do
No one's knocked you off your feet, they say what you want to hear
You're living proof that we don't always get what we deserve
But you're really nothing special
Just another crack in the sidewalk
You never meant anything to me
Or anyone for more than one night
No one's gonna stick around for when you're broken down and blacked out
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone
Keep falling over that same fucking step on your front porch
Most people learn from their mistakes
But you'll just stay here tripping on the same mistakes
You always do
Throw away your early twenties giving up on everyone and everything around you
It never came so easy
Throw away your early twenties giving up on everyone and everything around you
It never came so easy
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone
Keep falling over that same fucking step on your front porch
Most people learn from their mistakes
But you'll just stay here tripping on the same mistakes
You always do
You used to make me feel like I could walk on water
Now most nights I'm just sinking down and down
You're the reason why I can't listen to the same songs I used to
I write songs about you all the time
I bet I don't run through your mind
I've given up on you, but it still hurts to know you're not alone
Don't worry, I'll keep out of your life and stay awake at night
It's 4am and you're keeping me from closing these sleepy eyes
Does the thought of me keep you up at night?
Like the light on the ceiling of your bedroom
Lately, my dog's the only one around that listens to my problems
It's been a lonely year 
I write songs about you all the time
I bet I don't run through your mind
I've given up on you, but it still hurts to know you're not alone
Don't worry, I'll keep out of your life and stay awake at night
With just my skin and bones
It hurts to know you're not alone
I've given up on you, and my skin, and my bones
 

I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed

The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want
Knock me down
I'm not sure I have it in me to get back up
To be who I am seems exhausting anyway
You have a lot in common with my conscience
You both erase my confidence
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Back and forth
Between some kind of vague attachment to yesterday
And never knowing what form of myself I'll get today (to get today)
I'll always be a faded sign in your eyes
No matter what the point of view (point of view)
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
I'm not here
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want to hear
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Would you notice I'm not here
Am I telling myself the truth?
I'm used to pretending to be strong and clueless
Am I doing this right by you?
I seem to be coming off as wrong and ruthless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I changing my mind again?
All this indecision makes me shift my focus
Is the tension my only friend?
Anxiety holds my hand when life gets hopeless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I telling myself the truth about my self-esteem
And how others place their worth in me?
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
(The eyes of someone else)
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
Yeah, I'll keep smiling on the surface
(Am I telling myself the truth?)
"Smiling On The Surface" is the 3rd song released from the album "Composure". It was premiered on June 18, 2018.
Swallowing a feeling
Counting cracks across the ceiling
Never reached the depths of them before
Finding flaws in every format
I know but haven't shown that
I could pick myself up off the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Redefine rock bottom with these empty orange bottles
Never felt so paralysed before (never felt this paralysed)
We're all looking for some answers
With the hangman's broken lantern
Growing ever closer to the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Why do I, why do I, feel so damn cold?
Why am I, why am I, still so low?
Why should I, why should I, get up or get out?
Why should I?
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
Soft spoken, if ever out loud
These days not much gets out
My mind digs graves through the past
But never takes time to finish the act
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
No matter how cold it might get
My bed sheets are laced with regret
I try to fill in the lines
Rework the plans for a better design
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Here I am, bearing every burden
Here I am, showing every worry
To the world
To the world
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try
I'm at best your second option
Like a key under the mat
Are my emotions hard to read?
Seems I'm good at hiding
Reality
You disregard the consequences
Always seem to shift the blame
You burn the bridge and then I build it
Seems you're good at hiding
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
You make me feel helpless
Like a bird with broken wings
Forcing me to be more selfless
Lean on me, don't knock me over
It seems we're good at hiding
It seems we're good at fighting
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
I'm all alone
I feel sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
I'm all alone
I'm feeling sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
(There's nothing I can do)
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
Is there any chance you could cut me some slack?
Because I've been hanging for a while
From this withered rope
Forcing every sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
What could I ask that you help me hold back
Cause I've been falling for a while
Down this fucking slope
Losing any sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
There's a collage of photos framed
Dating '93 to '95
Though all it shows me is that
I'm just a bad seed
Falling off the family tree
I've got more complaints
More than pleasantries to say
Every monument is idly arranged
Every figure that has ever held importance in my life
I find nobody is who I pictured them to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the faces in reflections of the past
I feel so close but I can't reach through the glass
My life burns out and flickers like the end of a cigarette
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the light in your eyes
Turn the blind eye (Turn the blind eye)
"Why are you hurting me" she screamed from her death bed
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
It's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
The tears run down your cheekbones
I feel sorry for you
But I'm too fucking selfish to say I do
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be different
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Today I ripped myself wide open
And I saw that my heart isn't as fucked as I recalled
It's still flawed and
It's sorely stitched to my old ways
I thought it was buried, but it's just stuck
To my old ways
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be something else
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Shaking in the driver's seat
Staring at the dashboard
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
Please just stay
Please just stay
You see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
To take a chance on me
To take a chance
I still see us sitting on that old couch
'Til the sun comes up
Listening to sad songs
We spent our time with smiles on our faces
I know it sounds selfish but I'll miss those days
I know it sounds selfish
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
The Fall leaves flying through the driveway
Keep triggering these memories of you
I'm torn apart with how our lives are changing
I'm sure it sounds selfish, I'm just being honest
I know it sounds selfish
But I'm trying to be honest
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
Let's go back to when thing weren't complicated
Let's go back to all those old dashboard songs
Let's go back to smoking on the side of my old house
We can never go back, we'll never go back
We'll never go back
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
I know it sounds selfish
I'm just being honest
I can't fix everything around me
I can't make everybody happy
And it'll be okay
Show me how to be something other than nostalgic
I want to feel inspired and innocent again
I just want to be worth your time
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Lately when I'm alone I keep thinking about the past
I'm trying to feel weak in my knees again
I want to stand up straight like when I graduated
I just want to be
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Do you remember when you saw right through my selfish skin?
Do you remember when I ignored everything you did?
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
It'll be okay
We rush through our lives
Just to feel some kind of pride
Dismissing actualities is making matters worse
The ink will fade, but won't go away
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
I live in the middle of a lake
And I don't know how to swim
I've isolated everything
Everywhere I go I am consistently alone
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
Cautions only ever made me worry
You know that cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
The patience I once had is running away with my youth
Away in its hands
I've been neglecting who I am
That's just who I was back then
Don't need to be perfect, just happy
I'm still a lost boy
I'm still a lost boy
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
Every once in a while I listen to Death Cab and think about how it used to be 
We thought that we knew the answers
When no one was asking
Asking the questions 
I'm still a lost boy 
I'm still a lost boy 
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
It feels like I've been taking the long way for a while now
Haven't been at home in more years than I care to say
I keep letting my past cover what the present shouldn't be
What I shouldn't be
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
Staring out the window in my bedroom makes me think back
I see me as a boy out there
Lying in the grass
Singing songs with all the wrong notes
And graduating high school as my mom cries
I'm writing the same song over and over again
And feeling lost
I've always felt so lost
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I clenched the wheel the whole way home from Cleveland
With nothing more than my eyes half way open
And my hand smelling like smoke
Each mile I drive gets me closer to the streets that made me feel alone
I'm out of place and it doesn't feel wrong
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I care too much
While you don't even care at all
It's just sad that you don't even care
I walk up the stairs to your apartment and I feel small
The lowest feelings and even lower standards
Pictures of simple times are on the top shelf
You lie to me and say you're happy with the way things are
With the way things are
It's just sad, oh it's sad that you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I spent so much damn time trying to move forward
It hurts me to watch you falling backwards
Brave your life
Finding solutions, not making excuses
Find solutions and stop waiting for excuses
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I care too much, while you don't even care at all
A bit much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different
Don't settle because you're scared
You know I pictured things to be different
I pictured things to be different for you
For you
Could you stay here 'til I fall asleep?
We'll pretend that we could make each other feel complete
I'm looking for something that's not inside of you
Will you think of me when you drive home?
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
Last night I closed my eyes
And thought about someone that wasn't you
The weight of the world slipped off my shoulders
And weighed my back to the floor
It isn't where you want to be
I know this isn't where you want to be
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
You tell me I'm broken
As I stare out my window at the street lights
I walk outside and I sit in the shade at 3am
And I feel whole again
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
And I know we're disconnected
I'm getting pretty good at leaving, my patience isn't wearing thin
Autumn never ends in my head, no matter how far I've been
It feels like everybody is the branch and I'm the leaves
Falling from the top of every leafless tree
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
All I see is the past two years before I hit the ground
Time is moving slower on the way down (on the way down)
Save your time spent wondering what's going through my mind
Let me go before you see me following behind
I'll save you from myself
Just let me go
I'll save you from myself
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
I've learned that it's okay to be selfish
It keeps me from falling apart at the seams
Stuck is where I feel in place
A feeling I'll embrace
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
So much for bad luck
If I built a boat with apologies I've got
I'd have a sorry looking raft
It always rains
But it's nice to see
That someone else is sad
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
The coin's faced up
But I'm not feeling any better
A soap box made for every single fuck up
It's tough seeing where I am
Instead of where I'm from
My roots can get loose
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
Can you find your calling if nothing is calling for you?
I'm coughing up a lung trying to get rid of you
To get rid of you
To get rid of you
Can you find your calling
If nothing's calling for you?
For you?
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
When I heard my parents cry
I realized that we're all lost kids
Trying to find our way home
Blood is thicker than water
And I still feel like everyone I love forgot how to swim
At least there are pictures of my sister and me
Hanging on the wall in my garage
They always give me peace of mind
They always give me peace of mind
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I'm starting to see that
We're always changing
It's just so weird to think that we're always changing
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
I never spent my youth thinking of half the shit I'd go through
Living in the past never helped me
Last night I drove past the house that I grew up in
And tried to find that happiness
Living in the past never helped me
Or anyone move forward
There's no love, no growth for me here
Anymore, anymore
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I know this place is the same and that I'm changing
And I'm just
When I get stopped by a train on my drive home
I don't let it get to me like the rest of the world
I smile and think about how much I've grown over this year
It gives me time to open my mind and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that train
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine without you
I've laid to rest the shit that was always out of my hands
I finally sent all my skeletons away
Like everything I couldn't fix and people I couldn't change
Konstantine always tore me apart and made me cry
Now I hear that song and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that...
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine
Happiness, won't get me over this
Happiness, won't get me over anything, over anything 
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I spend my nights thinking the worst
And telling myself that everything's going to work out
I keep kicking myself in the mouth
Opening up every cut that should be a scar by now
I need the hope I always tell my friends about
I need the hope I always tell my friends about
I sleep with the TV on, it covers up my feelings about the past
Here I am lying awake thinking about how things used to be
I'm sick and tired
I'm sick and tired of being at the same old place in my head
Give me peace of mind
I always backtrack to my old self
When I'm holding on to despair and cracks in my life
I'm holding on when I need to let go
I sleep with the TV on, it covers up my feelings about the past
Here I am lying awake thinking about how things used to be
Doubt is the soil that fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
Doubt is the soil that fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
Doubt is the story of how fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
I'm dirty from head to toe
I'm dirty from head to toe
Change holds me down to the places I don't want to be
When I wake up I look in the mirror and I see
The person that's been scaring me away from moving on
And getting out of my head
I end my nights in the same spot that I told myself I would leave
I want to come home and have it be like it was before I left
I'm starting to see that I keep living alone in the past
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
I can't shake it off
Always a fight between my past,
My head, and my heart, you can cut me up
And spread me all over Illinois
I can't, I can't find myself
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
I'm stuck and I feel like I'm the only one
I end my nights in the same spot that I told myself I would leave
I want to come home and have it be like it was before I left
I'm starting to see that I keep living alone in the past
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
Did I get left behind?
Or is everybody else just hiding that they're lost
Loneliness will never leave my mind
Loneliness will never leave my mind
Did I get left behind?
Or is everybody else just hiding that they're lost
Just when I think I need someone, 
They wrap their arms around my old bones 
And I start breaking apart
I walk away from anyone that cares about me
But I swear my skin's not as rough as I make it out to be
The saddest part is I've been distant since I was sixteen
It keeps me up in bed
I'm stuck here with all the choices I've made 
And the chances I was too afraid to take
I've called myself young and stupid, 
But lately I feel old and desperate
I find it kind of weird how you find yourself 
When you have no one
I look for the right things in all the wrong places
The saddest part is I've been distant since I was sixteen
It keeps me up in bed
I'm stuck here with all the choices I've made 
And the chances I was too afraid to take
I found myself in a late night drives
Without a destination
All I had were thoughts about the past
And a list of my favorite songs to keep me company
But I still struggle and lose myself everyday
I always find myself lost in every line of all these songs
But I felt better when I saw that this is life
And in life were gonna cry
In life were gonna lose sleep
Were gonna feel helpless
But thats how its got to be 
When you lose yourself you'll find what you're looking for
I'm growing past who I used to be
As the night goes on 
I go from feeling out of place to feeling like a ghost
You miss me when I'm gone
But when I'm around it's like I'm hidden behind the paint on the walls
The loneliness will keep me warm tonight
It'll keep me warm seeing as you won't
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more than this
If the open road is my home I'm never leaving
All of the small towns make me throw away my biggest fears
And the big cities make the fucked up stuff feel smaller
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more than this
When I'm not here does anyone miss my secondhand smoke?
Do you wonder where I am or who I'm with?
Call me a mid-twenty sob story
I can't change the way I feel
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more,
Looking for something more
You were easy on my eyes
You were heavy on my heart
I never thought I'd live to see today
You're still in my mind
But not in my chest
I'm a little worn out since you fucking tore me down
You made me believe we had something
I guess that I was wrong
I thought I would be numb to this by now
I guess I was wrong
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
Stick with me or don't stick around at all
I was the boy who was too scared and ran away
I was the glue that never dried
You were the girl that made up her mind
And left me all alone to die
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
I'll sit on my basement floor
Turn off all the lights and try to not think about you
Just know that when I'm down there
I'll know that I won't be running through your mind
You were easy on my eyes
You were heavy on my heart
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
And I'll get through the winter without you
You made me believe we had something
Well I guess that I was wrong
I'm treated like an old book
That was left on the shelf
Everyone underlined what they wanted to read
And forgot the rest
My spine was left worn out and bent
So just take what you want from me
And forget the rest
It really weirds me out 
Because I never thought I'd be where I am today
My bones want to tear out of my skin
This isn't where I want to be
Getting older scares the shit out of me
I'm an old book
It's one of those nights where I'm scared to walk to my basement
These four walls, feel like they're caving in
There's pictures of you and me hidden behind my couch
I'll be waiting for the sun to shine through my window well
Am I trying to forget you or just cover you up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
I used to have an escape
But I ripped the map up a long time ago
So I'll lie to myself and say that I don't care at all
You'll always be hidden in the basement of everything I love
Am I trying to forget you or just cover you up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
The only time that I feel fine
Is when I'm parked in front of my house with tears in my eyes
I find comfort in weakness because it's always there for me
You'll always be hidden in the basement
Of everything I love
Are you trying to forget me or did you cover me up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
I can't believe you've got the nerve to say you love me
Then you left me for dead
I don't love you anymore
I hope you're happy since I don't know you anymore
You were a part of me 
And now you're just nothing but a memory
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
Now I'm just like the pictures that you take
I'm nothing but something that once was
Like colors that fade away in the sunlight
They're nothing special like they used to be
They're gone and they're never coming back
No, they're never coming back
I'm gone and I'm never coming back
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
I woke up today and realized that what we had is dead
I'm just a pile of lifeless bones to you
I've spent too many years thinking about somebody 
That doesn't even think about me
Thinking about somebody that doesn't even think about me
Thinking about somebody That doesn't even think about... 
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
Maybe this place is the same...
And we're just changing
Maybe this place is the same...
And we're just changing
I'm driving on state lines pretending you're standing there
But I know your feet will never be where my eyes fall again
Moving on is something I've always had trouble with
But this year I swear I'll get past it
If I had a backyard I would bury all my memories of you in it
Everything that we had would die right down in the dirt
I wish I had the guts to say this to your face
But the past five years took everything I had and ripped it out of me
You used to make me feel like I was something
Now you make me feel like absolutely nothing
I want to fall asleep and wake up four years ago
We were just kids who didn't know what love was
Or what we were digging ourselves into
I want to know if you ever hear 
All of these sad fucking songs I write about you
I wish I had the guts to say this to your face
But the past five years took everything I had and ripped it out of me
You used to make me feel like I was something
Now you make me feel like absolutely nothing
I know you probably hate who I've become
I'm just young and stupid, 
But that's the way I always want to be
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone 
You wouldn't know a good thing even if it slapped the makeup right off of your face
Burn down the bridges just in time for last call
Keep digging yourself neck deep into selfishness
I doubt that you'll ever find out who you really are
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone
Keep falling over that same fucking step on your front porch
Most people learn from their mistakes
But you'll just stay here tripping on the same mistakes
You always do
No one's knocked you off your feet, they say what you want to hear
You're living proof that we don't always get what we deserve
But you're really nothing special
Just another crack in the sidewalk
You never meant anything to me
Or anyone for more than one night
No one's gonna stick around for when you're broken down and blacked out
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone
Keep falling over that same fucking step on your front porch
Most people learn from their mistakes
But you'll just stay here tripping on the same mistakes
You always do
Throw away your early twenties giving up on everyone and everything around you
It never came so easy
Throw away your early twenties giving up on everyone and everything around you
It never came so easy
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone
Keep falling over that same fucking step on your front porch
Most people learn from their mistakes
But you'll just stay here tripping on the same mistakes
You always do
You used to make me feel like I could walk on water
Now most nights I'm just sinking down and down
You're the reason why I can't listen to the same songs I used to
I write songs about you all the time
I bet I don't run through your mind
I've given up on you, but it still hurts to know you're not alone
Don't worry, I'll keep out of your life and stay awake at night
It's 4am and you're keeping me from closing these sleepy eyes
Does the thought of me keep you up at night?
Like the light on the ceiling of your bedroom
Lately, my dog's the only one around that listens to my problems
It's been a lonely year 
I write songs about you all the time
I bet I don't run through your mind
I've given up on you, but it still hurts to know you're not alone
Don't worry, I'll keep out of your life and stay awake at night
With just my skin and bones
It hurts to know you're not alone
I've given up on you, and my skin, and my bones
Spit in my face, tell me I didn't mean what I said
I'll take those words with me when I'm dead
Open your mouth and contradict everything you said last summer
I don't even know you anymore, anymore
You really fucked me up this time for good, even though you didn't mean to
When the weather clears, that sweatshirt weather won't keep you warm like I do
You'll be thinking of my sleepy eyes and bony knees
You'll be thinking of me
Maybe I'll run away from home, fake my own death and see if you really care
A week goes by, I doubt you'll be waiting around for me at all
No matter how many times I walk up my driveway, you won't be there
You're nowhere to be found because everything you said was a lie
You really fucked me up this time for good, even though you didn't mean to
When the weather clears, that sweatshirt weather won't keep you warm like I do
You'll be thinking of my sleepy eyes and bony knees
You'll be thinking of me
You wanted me when I was running away
I needed you when I ripped your heart out
I can't count the times we fell apart
We can't go back, it's not the same
You really fucked me up this time for good, even though you didn't mean to
When the weather clears, that sweatshirt weather won't keep you warm like I do
You'll be thinking of my sleepy eyes and bony knees
You'll be thinking of me
When something's fallen apart as many times as us
I can't put it back together, it's not the same
 

I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out

"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want
Knock me down
I'm not sure I have it in me to get back up
To be who I am seems exhausting anyway
You have a lot in common with my conscience
You both erase my confidence
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Back and forth
Between some kind of vague attachment to yesterday
And never knowing what form of myself I'll get today (to get today)
I'll always be a faded sign in your eyes
No matter what the point of view (point of view)
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
I'm not here
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want to hear
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Would you notice I'm not here
Am I telling myself the truth?
I'm used to pretending to be strong and clueless
Am I doing this right by you?
I seem to be coming off as wrong and ruthless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I changing my mind again?
All this indecision makes me shift my focus
Is the tension my only friend?
Anxiety holds my hand when life gets hopeless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I telling myself the truth about my self-esteem
And how others place their worth in me?
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
(The eyes of someone else)
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
Yeah, I'll keep smiling on the surface
(Am I telling myself the truth?)
"Smiling On The Surface" is the 3rd song released from the album "Composure". It was premiered on June 18, 2018.
Swallowing a feeling
Counting cracks across the ceiling
Never reached the depths of them before
Finding flaws in every format
I know but haven't shown that
I could pick myself up off the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Redefine rock bottom with these empty orange bottles
Never felt so paralysed before (never felt this paralysed)
We're all looking for some answers
With the hangman's broken lantern
Growing ever closer to the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Why do I, why do I, feel so damn cold?
Why am I, why am I, still so low?
Why should I, why should I, get up or get out?
Why should I?
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
Soft spoken, if ever out loud
These days not much gets out
My mind digs graves through the past
But never takes time to finish the act
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
No matter how cold it might get
My bed sheets are laced with regret
I try to fill in the lines
Rework the plans for a better design
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Here I am, bearing every burden
Here I am, showing every worry
To the world
To the world
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try
I'm at best your second option
Like a key under the mat
Are my emotions hard to read?
Seems I'm good at hiding
Reality
You disregard the consequences
Always seem to shift the blame
You burn the bridge and then I build it
Seems you're good at hiding
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
You make me feel helpless
Like a bird with broken wings
Forcing me to be more selfless
Lean on me, don't knock me over
It seems we're good at hiding
It seems we're good at fighting
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
I'm all alone
I feel sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
I'm all alone
I'm feeling sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
(There's nothing I can do)
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
Is there any chance you could cut me some slack?
Because I've been hanging for a while
From this withered rope
Forcing every sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
What could I ask that you help me hold back
Cause I've been falling for a while
Down this fucking slope
Losing any sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
There's a collage of photos framed
Dating '93 to '95
Though all it shows me is that
I'm just a bad seed
Falling off the family tree
I've got more complaints
More than pleasantries to say
Every monument is idly arranged
Every figure that has ever held importance in my life
I find nobody is who I pictured them to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the faces in reflections of the past
I feel so close but I can't reach through the glass
My life burns out and flickers like the end of a cigarette
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the light in your eyes
Turn the blind eye (Turn the blind eye)
"Why are you hurting me" she screamed from her death bed
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
It's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
The tears run down your cheekbones
I feel sorry for you
But I'm too fucking selfish to say I do
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be different
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Today I ripped myself wide open
And I saw that my heart isn't as fucked as I recalled
It's still flawed and
It's sorely stitched to my old ways
I thought it was buried, but it's just stuck
To my old ways
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be something else
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Shaking in the driver's seat
Staring at the dashboard
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
Please just stay
Please just stay
You see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
To take a chance on me
To take a chance
I still see us sitting on that old couch
'Til the sun comes up
Listening to sad songs
We spent our time with smiles on our faces
I know it sounds selfish but I'll miss those days
I know it sounds selfish
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
The Fall leaves flying through the driveway
Keep triggering these memories of you
I'm torn apart with how our lives are changing
I'm sure it sounds selfish, I'm just being honest
I know it sounds selfish
But I'm trying to be honest
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
Let's go back to when thing weren't complicated
Let's go back to all those old dashboard songs
Let's go back to smoking on the side of my old house
We can never go back, we'll never go back
We'll never go back
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
I know it sounds selfish
I'm just being honest
I can't fix everything around me
I can't make everybody happy
And it'll be okay
Show me how to be something other than nostalgic
I want to feel inspired and innocent again
I just want to be worth your time
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Lately when I'm alone I keep thinking about the past
I'm trying to feel weak in my knees again
I want to stand up straight like when I graduated
I just want to be
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Do you remember when you saw right through my selfish skin?
Do you remember when I ignored everything you did?
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
It'll be okay
We rush through our lives
Just to feel some kind of pride
Dismissing actualities is making matters worse
The ink will fade, but won't go away
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
I live in the middle of a lake
And I don't know how to swim
I've isolated everything
Everywhere I go I am consistently alone
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
Cautions only ever made me worry
You know that cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
The patience I once had is running away with my youth
Away in its hands
I've been neglecting who I am
That's just who I was back then
Don't need to be perfect, just happy
I'm still a lost boy
I'm still a lost boy
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
Every once in a while I listen to Death Cab and think about how it used to be 
We thought that we knew the answers
When no one was asking
Asking the questions 
I'm still a lost boy 
I'm still a lost boy 
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
It feels like I've been taking the long way for a while now
Haven't been at home in more years than I care to say
I keep letting my past cover what the present shouldn't be
What I shouldn't be
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
Staring out the window in my bedroom makes me think back
I see me as a boy out there
Lying in the grass
Singing songs with all the wrong notes
And graduating high school as my mom cries
I'm writing the same song over and over again
And feeling lost
I've always felt so lost
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I clenched the wheel the whole way home from Cleveland
With nothing more than my eyes half way open
And my hand smelling like smoke
Each mile I drive gets me closer to the streets that made me feel alone
I'm out of place and it doesn't feel wrong
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I care too much
While you don't even care at all
It's just sad that you don't even care
I walk up the stairs to your apartment and I feel small
The lowest feelings and even lower standards
Pictures of simple times are on the top shelf
You lie to me and say you're happy with the way things are
With the way things are
It's just sad, oh it's sad that you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I spent so much damn time trying to move forward
It hurts me to watch you falling backwards
Brave your life
Finding solutions, not making excuses
Find solutions and stop waiting for excuses
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I care too much, while you don't even care at all
A bit much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different
Don't settle because you're scared
You know I pictured things to be different
I pictured things to be different for you
For you
Could you stay here 'til I fall asleep?
We'll pretend that we could make each other feel complete
I'm looking for something that's not inside of you
Will you think of me when you drive home?
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
Last night I closed my eyes
And thought about someone that wasn't you
The weight of the world slipped off my shoulders
And weighed my back to the floor
It isn't where you want to be
I know this isn't where you want to be
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
You tell me I'm broken
As I stare out my window at the street lights
I walk outside and I sit in the shade at 3am
And I feel whole again
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
And I know we're disconnected
I'm getting pretty good at leaving, my patience isn't wearing thin
Autumn never ends in my head, no matter how far I've been
It feels like everybody is the branch and I'm the leaves
Falling from the top of every leafless tree
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
All I see is the past two years before I hit the ground
Time is moving slower on the way down (on the way down)
Save your time spent wondering what's going through my mind
Let me go before you see me following behind
I'll save you from myself
Just let me go
I'll save you from myself
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
I've learned that it's okay to be selfish
It keeps me from falling apart at the seams
Stuck is where I feel in place
A feeling I'll embrace
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
So much for bad luck
If I built a boat with apologies I've got
I'd have a sorry looking raft
It always rains
But it's nice to see
That someone else is sad
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
The coin's faced up
But I'm not feeling any better
A soap box made for every single fuck up
It's tough seeing where I am
Instead of where I'm from
My roots can get loose
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
Can you find your calling if nothing is calling for you?
I'm coughing up a lung trying to get rid of you
To get rid of you
To get rid of you
Can you find your calling
If nothing's calling for you?
For you?
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
When I heard my parents cry
I realized that we're all lost kids
Trying to find our way home
Blood is thicker than water
And I still feel like everyone I love forgot how to swim
At least there are pictures of my sister and me
Hanging on the wall in my garage
They always give me peace of mind
They always give me peace of mind
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I'm starting to see that
We're always changing
It's just so weird to think that we're always changing
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
I never spent my youth thinking of half the shit I'd go through
Living in the past never helped me
Last night I drove past the house that I grew up in
And tried to find that happiness
Living in the past never helped me
Or anyone move forward
There's no love, no growth for me here
Anymore, anymore
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I know this place is the same and that I'm changing
And I'm just
When I get stopped by a train on my drive home
I don't let it get to me like the rest of the world
I smile and think about how much I've grown over this year
It gives me time to open my mind and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that train
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine without you
I've laid to rest the shit that was always out of my hands
I finally sent all my skeletons away
Like everything I couldn't fix and people I couldn't change
Konstantine always tore me apart and made me cry
Now I hear that song and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that...
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine
Happiness, won't get me over this
Happiness, won't get me over anything, over anything 
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I spend my nights thinking the worst
And telling myself that everything's going to work out
I keep kicking myself in the mouth
Opening up every cut that should be a scar by now
I need the hope I always tell my friends about
I need the hope I always tell my friends about
I sleep with the TV on, it covers up my feelings about the past
Here I am lying awake thinking about how things used to be
I'm sick and tired
I'm sick and tired of being at the same old place in my head
Give me peace of mind
I always backtrack to my old self
When I'm holding on to despair and cracks in my life
I'm holding on when I need to let go
I sleep with the TV on, it covers up my feelings about the past
Here I am lying awake thinking about how things used to be
Doubt is the soil that fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
Doubt is the soil that fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
Doubt is the story of how fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
I'm dirty from head to toe
I'm dirty from head to toe
Change holds me down to the places I don't want to be
When I wake up I look in the mirror and I see
The person that's been scaring me away from moving on
And getting out of my head
I end my nights in the same spot that I told myself I would leave
I want to come home and have it be like it was before I left
I'm starting to see that I keep living alone in the past
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
I can't shake it off
Always a fight between my past,
My head, and my heart, you can cut me up
And spread me all over Illinois
I can't, I can't find myself
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
I'm stuck and I feel like I'm the only one
I end my nights in the same spot that I told myself I would leave
I want to come home and have it be like it was before I left
I'm starting to see that I keep living alone in the past
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
Did I get left behind?
Or is everybody else just hiding that they're lost
Loneliness will never leave my mind
Loneliness will never leave my mind
Did I get left behind?
Or is everybody else just hiding that they're lost
Just when I think I need someone, 
They wrap their arms around my old bones 
And I start breaking apart
I walk away from anyone that cares about me
But I swear my skin's not as rough as I make it out to be
The saddest part is I've been distant since I was sixteen
It keeps me up in bed
I'm stuck here with all the choices I've made 
And the chances I was too afraid to take
I've called myself young and stupid, 
But lately I feel old and desperate
I find it kind of weird how you find yourself 
When you have no one
I look for the right things in all the wrong places
The saddest part is I've been distant since I was sixteen
It keeps me up in bed
I'm stuck here with all the choices I've made 
And the chances I was too afraid to take
I found myself in a late night drives
Without a destination
All I had were thoughts about the past
And a list of my favorite songs to keep me company
But I still struggle and lose myself everyday
I always find myself lost in every line of all these songs
But I felt better when I saw that this is life
And in life were gonna cry
In life were gonna lose sleep
Were gonna feel helpless
But thats how its got to be 
When you lose yourself you'll find what you're looking for
I'm growing past who I used to be
As the night goes on 
I go from feeling out of place to feeling like a ghost
You miss me when I'm gone
But when I'm around it's like I'm hidden behind the paint on the walls
The loneliness will keep me warm tonight
It'll keep me warm seeing as you won't
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more than this
If the open road is my home I'm never leaving
All of the small towns make me throw away my biggest fears
And the big cities make the fucked up stuff feel smaller
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more than this
When I'm not here does anyone miss my secondhand smoke?
Do you wonder where I am or who I'm with?
Call me a mid-twenty sob story
I can't change the way I feel
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more,
Looking for something more
You were easy on my eyes
You were heavy on my heart
I never thought I'd live to see today
You're still in my mind
But not in my chest
I'm a little worn out since you fucking tore me down
You made me believe we had something
I guess that I was wrong
I thought I would be numb to this by now
I guess I was wrong
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
Stick with me or don't stick around at all
I was the boy who was too scared and ran away
I was the glue that never dried
You were the girl that made up her mind
And left me all alone to die
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
I'll sit on my basement floor
Turn off all the lights and try to not think about you
Just know that when I'm down there
I'll know that I won't be running through your mind
You were easy on my eyes
You were heavy on my heart
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
And I'll get through the winter without you
You made me believe we had something
Well I guess that I was wrong
I'm treated like an old book
That was left on the shelf
Everyone underlined what they wanted to read
And forgot the rest
My spine was left worn out and bent
So just take what you want from me
And forget the rest
It really weirds me out 
Because I never thought I'd be where I am today
My bones want to tear out of my skin
This isn't where I want to be
Getting older scares the shit out of me
I'm an old book
It's one of those nights where I'm scared to walk to my basement
These four walls, feel like they're caving in
There's pictures of you and me hidden behind my couch
I'll be waiting for the sun to shine through my window well
Am I trying to forget you or just cover you up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
I used to have an escape
But I ripped the map up a long time ago
So I'll lie to myself and say that I don't care at all
You'll always be hidden in the basement of everything I love
Am I trying to forget you or just cover you up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
The only time that I feel fine
Is when I'm parked in front of my house with tears in my eyes
I find comfort in weakness because it's always there for me
You'll always be hidden in the basement
Of everything I love
Are you trying to forget me or did you cover me up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
I can't believe you've got the nerve to say you love me
Then you left me for dead
I don't love you anymore
I hope you're happy since I don't know you anymore
You were a part of me 
And now you're just nothing but a memory
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
Now I'm just like the pictures that you take
I'm nothing but something that once was
Like colors that fade away in the sunlight
They're nothing special like they used to be
They're gone and they're never coming back
No, they're never coming back
I'm gone and I'm never coming back
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
I woke up today and realized that what we had is dead
I'm just a pile of lifeless bones to you
I've spent too many years thinking about somebody 
That doesn't even think about me
Thinking about somebody that doesn't even think about me
Thinking about somebody That doesn't even think about... 
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
Maybe this place is the same...
And we're just changing
Maybe this place is the same...
And we're just changing
I'm driving on state lines pretending you're standing there
But I know your feet will never be where my eyes fall again
Moving on is something I've always had trouble with
But this year I swear I'll get past it
If I had a backyard I would bury all my memories of you in it
Everything that we had would die right down in the dirt
I wish I had the guts to say this to your face
But the past five years took everything I had and ripped it out of me
You used to make me feel like I was something
Now you make me feel like absolutely nothing
I want to fall asleep and wake up four years ago
We were just kids who didn't know what love was
Or what we were digging ourselves into
I want to know if you ever hear 
All of these sad fucking songs I write about you
I wish I had the guts to say this to your face
But the past five years took everything I had and ripped it out of me
You used to make me feel like I was something
Now you make me feel like absolutely nothing
I know you probably hate who I've become
I'm just young and stupid, 
But that's the way I always want to be
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone 
You wouldn't know a good thing even if it slapped the makeup right off of your face
Burn down the bridges just in time for last call
Keep digging yourself neck deep into selfishness
I doubt that you'll ever find out who you really are
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone
Keep falling over that same fucking step on your front porch
Most people learn from their mistakes
But you'll just stay here tripping on the same mistakes
You always do
No one's knocked you off your feet, they say what you want to hear
You're living proof that we don't always get what we deserve
But you're really nothing special
Just another crack in the sidewalk
You never meant anything to me
Or anyone for more than one night
No one's gonna stick around for when you're broken down and blacked out
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone
Keep falling over that same fucking step on your front porch
Most people learn from their mistakes
But you'll just stay here tripping on the same mistakes
You always do
Throw away your early twenties giving up on everyone and everything around you
It never came so easy
Throw away your early twenties giving up on everyone and everything around you
It never came so easy
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone
Keep falling over that same fucking step on your front porch
Most people learn from their mistakes
But you'll just stay here tripping on the same mistakes
You always do
You used to make me feel like I could walk on water
Now most nights I'm just sinking down and down
You're the reason why I can't listen to the same songs I used to
I write songs about you all the time
I bet I don't run through your mind
I've given up on you, but it still hurts to know you're not alone
Don't worry, I'll keep out of your life and stay awake at night
It's 4am and you're keeping me from closing these sleepy eyes
Does the thought of me keep you up at night?
Like the light on the ceiling of your bedroom
Lately, my dog's the only one around that listens to my problems
It's been a lonely year 
I write songs about you all the time
I bet I don't run through your mind
I've given up on you, but it still hurts to know you're not alone
Don't worry, I'll keep out of your life and stay awake at night
With just my skin and bones
It hurts to know you're not alone
I've given up on you, and my skin, and my bones
Spit in my face, tell me I didn't mean what I said
I'll take those words with me when I'm dead
Open your mouth and contradict everything you said last summer
I don't even know you anymore, anymore
You really fucked me up this time for good, even though you didn't mean to
When the weather clears, that sweatshirt weather won't keep you warm like I do
You'll be thinking of my sleepy eyes and bony knees
You'll be thinking of me
Maybe I'll run away from home, fake my own death and see if you really care
A week goes by, I doubt you'll be waiting around for me at all
No matter how many times I walk up my driveway, you won't be there
You're nowhere to be found because everything you said was a lie
You really fucked me up this time for good, even though you didn't mean to
When the weather clears, that sweatshirt weather won't keep you warm like I do
You'll be thinking of my sleepy eyes and bony knees
You'll be thinking of me
You wanted me when I was running away
I needed you when I ripped your heart out
I can't count the times we fell apart
We can't go back, it's not the same
You really fucked me up this time for good, even though you didn't mean to
When the weather clears, that sweatshirt weather won't keep you warm like I do
You'll be thinking of my sleepy eyes and bony knees
You'll be thinking of me
When something's fallen apart as many times as us
I can't put it back together, it's not the same
This time around I wasn't honest enough with how I really felt
I'll spend the winter blending into the streets and sidewalks that make up this town
At least it gave me someone else to write another one of these sad fucking songs about
You're just another sad song to me
I've got this lonely night and Jimmy Eat World
I never had you and you told me I never did
The truth is you won't even be there when I can't stand on my own two feet
You won't be here
I saw right through you on my basement floor
But could you even see past my chest?
Could you ever feel past these hands?
Your intentions were only skin deep
Mine weren't honest enough to fall past my teeth
I've got this lonely night and Jimmy Eat World
I never had you and you told me I never did
The truth is you won't even be there when I can't stand on my own two feet
You won't be here
Will I ever know how it feels to be home again?
I've been told that home is where the heart is
If that's the case, I've never been home 
I've got this lonely night and Jimmy Eat World
I never had you and you told me I never did
The truth is you won't even be there when I can't stand on my own two feet
You won't be here
 

I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out

But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back

"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want
Knock me down
I'm not sure I have it in me to get back up
To be who I am seems exhausting anyway
You have a lot in common with my conscience
You both erase my confidence
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Back and forth
Between some kind of vague attachment to yesterday
And never knowing what form of myself I'll get today (to get today)
I'll always be a faded sign in your eyes
No matter what the point of view (point of view)
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
I'm not here
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want to hear
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Would you notice I'm not here
Am I telling myself the truth?
I'm used to pretending to be strong and clueless
Am I doing this right by you?
I seem to be coming off as wrong and ruthless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I changing my mind again?
All this indecision makes me shift my focus
Is the tension my only friend?
Anxiety holds my hand when life gets hopeless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I telling myself the truth about my self-esteem
And how others place their worth in me?
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
(The eyes of someone else)
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
Yeah, I'll keep smiling on the surface
(Am I telling myself the truth?)
"Smiling On The Surface" is the 3rd song released from the album "Composure". It was premiered on June 18, 2018.
Swallowing a feeling
Counting cracks across the ceiling
Never reached the depths of them before
Finding flaws in every format
I know but haven't shown that
I could pick myself up off the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Redefine rock bottom with these empty orange bottles
Never felt so paralysed before (never felt this paralysed)
We're all looking for some answers
With the hangman's broken lantern
Growing ever closer to the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Why do I, why do I, feel so damn cold?
Why am I, why am I, still so low?
Why should I, why should I, get up or get out?
Why should I?
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
Soft spoken, if ever out loud
These days not much gets out
My mind digs graves through the past
But never takes time to finish the act
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
No matter how cold it might get
My bed sheets are laced with regret
I try to fill in the lines
Rework the plans for a better design
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Here I am, bearing every burden
Here I am, showing every worry
To the world
To the world
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try
I'm at best your second option
Like a key under the mat
Are my emotions hard to read?
Seems I'm good at hiding
Reality
You disregard the consequences
Always seem to shift the blame
You burn the bridge and then I build it
Seems you're good at hiding
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
You make me feel helpless
Like a bird with broken wings
Forcing me to be more selfless
Lean on me, don't knock me over
It seems we're good at hiding
It seems we're good at fighting
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
I'm all alone
I feel sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
I'm all alone
I'm feeling sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
(There's nothing I can do)
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
Is there any chance you could cut me some slack?
Because I've been hanging for a while
From this withered rope
Forcing every sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
What could I ask that you help me hold back
Cause I've been falling for a while
Down this fucking slope
Losing any sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
There's a collage of photos framed
Dating '93 to '95
Though all it shows me is that
I'm just a bad seed
Falling off the family tree
I've got more complaints
More than pleasantries to say
Every monument is idly arranged
Every figure that has ever held importance in my life
I find nobody is who I pictured them to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the faces in reflections of the past
I feel so close but I can't reach through the glass
My life burns out and flickers like the end of a cigarette
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the light in your eyes
Turn the blind eye (Turn the blind eye)
"Why are you hurting me" she screamed from her death bed
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
It's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
The tears run down your cheekbones
I feel sorry for you
But I'm too fucking selfish to say I do
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be different
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Today I ripped myself wide open
And I saw that my heart isn't as fucked as I recalled
It's still flawed and
It's sorely stitched to my old ways
I thought it was buried, but it's just stuck
To my old ways
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be something else
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Shaking in the driver's seat
Staring at the dashboard
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
Please just stay
Please just stay
You see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
To take a chance on me
To take a chance
I still see us sitting on that old couch
'Til the sun comes up
Listening to sad songs
We spent our time with smiles on our faces
I know it sounds selfish but I'll miss those days
I know it sounds selfish
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
The Fall leaves flying through the driveway
Keep triggering these memories of you
I'm torn apart with how our lives are changing
I'm sure it sounds selfish, I'm just being honest
I know it sounds selfish
But I'm trying to be honest
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
Let's go back to when thing weren't complicated
Let's go back to all those old dashboard songs
Let's go back to smoking on the side of my old house
We can never go back, we'll never go back
We'll never go back
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
I know it sounds selfish
I'm just being honest
I can't fix everything around me
I can't make everybody happy
And it'll be okay
Show me how to be something other than nostalgic
I want to feel inspired and innocent again
I just want to be worth your time
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Lately when I'm alone I keep thinking about the past
I'm trying to feel weak in my knees again
I want to stand up straight like when I graduated
I just want to be
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Do you remember when you saw right through my selfish skin?
Do you remember when I ignored everything you did?
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
It'll be okay
We rush through our lives
Just to feel some kind of pride
Dismissing actualities is making matters worse
The ink will fade, but won't go away
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
I live in the middle of a lake
And I don't know how to swim
I've isolated everything
Everywhere I go I am consistently alone
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
Cautions only ever made me worry
You know that cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
The patience I once had is running away with my youth
Away in its hands
I've been neglecting who I am
That's just who I was back then
Don't need to be perfect, just happy
I'm still a lost boy
I'm still a lost boy
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
Every once in a while I listen to Death Cab and think about how it used to be 
We thought that we knew the answers
When no one was asking
Asking the questions 
I'm still a lost boy 
I'm still a lost boy 
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
It feels like I've been taking the long way for a while now
Haven't been at home in more years than I care to say
I keep letting my past cover what the present shouldn't be
What I shouldn't be
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
Staring out the window in my bedroom makes me think back
I see me as a boy out there
Lying in the grass
Singing songs with all the wrong notes
And graduating high school as my mom cries
I'm writing the same song over and over again
And feeling lost
I've always felt so lost
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I clenched the wheel the whole way home from Cleveland
With nothing more than my eyes half way open
And my hand smelling like smoke
Each mile I drive gets me closer to the streets that made me feel alone
I'm out of place and it doesn't feel wrong
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I care too much
While you don't even care at all
It's just sad that you don't even care
I walk up the stairs to your apartment and I feel small
The lowest feelings and even lower standards
Pictures of simple times are on the top shelf
You lie to me and say you're happy with the way things are
With the way things are
It's just sad, oh it's sad that you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I spent so much damn time trying to move forward
It hurts me to watch you falling backwards
Brave your life
Finding solutions, not making excuses
Find solutions and stop waiting for excuses
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I care too much, while you don't even care at all
A bit much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different
Don't settle because you're scared
You know I pictured things to be different
I pictured things to be different for you
For you
Could you stay here 'til I fall asleep?
We'll pretend that we could make each other feel complete
I'm looking for something that's not inside of you
Will you think of me when you drive home?
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
Last night I closed my eyes
And thought about someone that wasn't you
The weight of the world slipped off my shoulders
And weighed my back to the floor
It isn't where you want to be
I know this isn't where you want to be
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
You tell me I'm broken
As I stare out my window at the street lights
I walk outside and I sit in the shade at 3am
And I feel whole again
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
And I know we're disconnected
I'm getting pretty good at leaving, my patience isn't wearing thin
Autumn never ends in my head, no matter how far I've been
It feels like everybody is the branch and I'm the leaves
Falling from the top of every leafless tree
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
All I see is the past two years before I hit the ground
Time is moving slower on the way down (on the way down)
Save your time spent wondering what's going through my mind
Let me go before you see me following behind
I'll save you from myself
Just let me go
I'll save you from myself
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
I've learned that it's okay to be selfish
It keeps me from falling apart at the seams
Stuck is where I feel in place
A feeling I'll embrace
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
So much for bad luck
If I built a boat with apologies I've got
I'd have a sorry looking raft
It always rains
But it's nice to see
That someone else is sad
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
The coin's faced up
But I'm not feeling any better
A soap box made for every single fuck up
It's tough seeing where I am
Instead of where I'm from
My roots can get loose
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
Can you find your calling if nothing is calling for you?
I'm coughing up a lung trying to get rid of you
To get rid of you
To get rid of you
Can you find your calling
If nothing's calling for you?
For you?
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
When I heard my parents cry
I realized that we're all lost kids
Trying to find our way home
Blood is thicker than water
And I still feel like everyone I love forgot how to swim
At least there are pictures of my sister and me
Hanging on the wall in my garage
They always give me peace of mind
They always give me peace of mind
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I'm starting to see that
We're always changing
It's just so weird to think that we're always changing
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
I never spent my youth thinking of half the shit I'd go through
Living in the past never helped me
Last night I drove past the house that I grew up in
And tried to find that happiness
Living in the past never helped me
Or anyone move forward
There's no love, no growth for me here
Anymore, anymore
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I know this place is the same and that I'm changing
And I'm just
When I get stopped by a train on my drive home
I don't let it get to me like the rest of the world
I smile and think about how much I've grown over this year
It gives me time to open my mind and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that train
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine without you
I've laid to rest the shit that was always out of my hands
I finally sent all my skeletons away
Like everything I couldn't fix and people I couldn't change
Konstantine always tore me apart and made me cry
Now I hear that song and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that...
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine
Happiness, won't get me over this
Happiness, won't get me over anything, over anything 
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I spend my nights thinking the worst
And telling myself that everything's going to work out
I keep kicking myself in the mouth
Opening up every cut that should be a scar by now
I need the hope I always tell my friends about
I need the hope I always tell my friends about
I sleep with the TV on, it covers up my feelings about the past
Here I am lying awake thinking about how things used to be
I'm sick and tired
I'm sick and tired of being at the same old place in my head
Give me peace of mind
I always backtrack to my old self
When I'm holding on to despair and cracks in my life
I'm holding on when I need to let go
I sleep with the TV on, it covers up my feelings about the past
Here I am lying awake thinking about how things used to be
Doubt is the soil that fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
Doubt is the soil that fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
Doubt is the story of how fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
I'm dirty from head to toe
I'm dirty from head to toe
Change holds me down to the places I don't want to be
When I wake up I look in the mirror and I see
The person that's been scaring me away from moving on
And getting out of my head
I end my nights in the same spot that I told myself I would leave
I want to come home and have it be like it was before I left
I'm starting to see that I keep living alone in the past
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
I can't shake it off
Always a fight between my past,
My head, and my heart, you can cut me up
And spread me all over Illinois
I can't, I can't find myself
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
I'm stuck and I feel like I'm the only one
I end my nights in the same spot that I told myself I would leave
I want to come home and have it be like it was before I left
I'm starting to see that I keep living alone in the past
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
Did I get left behind?
Or is everybody else just hiding that they're lost
Loneliness will never leave my mind
Loneliness will never leave my mind
Did I get left behind?
Or is everybody else just hiding that they're lost
Just when I think I need someone, 
They wrap their arms around my old bones 
And I start breaking apart
I walk away from anyone that cares about me
But I swear my skin's not as rough as I make it out to be
The saddest part is I've been distant since I was sixteen
It keeps me up in bed
I'm stuck here with all the choices I've made 
And the chances I was too afraid to take
I've called myself young and stupid, 
But lately I feel old and desperate
I find it kind of weird how you find yourself 
When you have no one
I look for the right things in all the wrong places
The saddest part is I've been distant since I was sixteen
It keeps me up in bed
I'm stuck here with all the choices I've made 
And the chances I was too afraid to take
I found myself in a late night drives
Without a destination
All I had were thoughts about the past
And a list of my favorite songs to keep me company
But I still struggle and lose myself everyday
I always find myself lost in every line of all these songs
But I felt better when I saw that this is life
And in life were gonna cry
In life were gonna lose sleep
Were gonna feel helpless
But thats how its got to be 
When you lose yourself you'll find what you're looking for
I'm growing past who I used to be
As the night goes on 
I go from feeling out of place to feeling like a ghost
You miss me when I'm gone
But when I'm around it's like I'm hidden behind the paint on the walls
The loneliness will keep me warm tonight
It'll keep me warm seeing as you won't
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more than this
If the open road is my home I'm never leaving
All of the small towns make me throw away my biggest fears
And the big cities make the fucked up stuff feel smaller
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more than this
When I'm not here does anyone miss my secondhand smoke?
Do you wonder where I am or who I'm with?
Call me a mid-twenty sob story
I can't change the way I feel
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more,
Looking for something more
You were easy on my eyes
You were heavy on my heart
I never thought I'd live to see today
You're still in my mind
But not in my chest
I'm a little worn out since you fucking tore me down
You made me believe we had something
I guess that I was wrong
I thought I would be numb to this by now
I guess I was wrong
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
Stick with me or don't stick around at all
I was the boy who was too scared and ran away
I was the glue that never dried
You were the girl that made up her mind
And left me all alone to die
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
I'll sit on my basement floor
Turn off all the lights and try to not think about you
Just know that when I'm down there
I'll know that I won't be running through your mind
You were easy on my eyes
You were heavy on my heart
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
And I'll get through the winter without you
You made me believe we had something
Well I guess that I was wrong
I'm treated like an old book
That was left on the shelf
Everyone underlined what they wanted to read
And forgot the rest
My spine was left worn out and bent
So just take what you want from me
And forget the rest
It really weirds me out 
Because I never thought I'd be where I am today
My bones want to tear out of my skin
This isn't where I want to be
Getting older scares the shit out of me
I'm an old book
It's one of those nights where I'm scared to walk to my basement
These four walls, feel like they're caving in
There's pictures of you and me hidden behind my couch
I'll be waiting for the sun to shine through my window well
Am I trying to forget you or just cover you up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
I used to have an escape
But I ripped the map up a long time ago
So I'll lie to myself and say that I don't care at all
You'll always be hidden in the basement of everything I love
Am I trying to forget you or just cover you up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
The only time that I feel fine
Is when I'm parked in front of my house with tears in my eyes
I find comfort in weakness because it's always there for me
You'll always be hidden in the basement
Of everything I love
Are you trying to forget me or did you cover me up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
I can't believe you've got the nerve to say you love me
Then you left me for dead
I don't love you anymore
I hope you're happy since I don't know you anymore
You were a part of me 
And now you're just nothing but a memory
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
Now I'm just like the pictures that you take
I'm nothing but something that once was
Like colors that fade away in the sunlight
They're nothing special like they used to be
They're gone and they're never coming back
No, they're never coming back
I'm gone and I'm never coming back
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
I woke up today and realized that what we had is dead
I'm just a pile of lifeless bones to you
I've spent too many years thinking about somebody 
That doesn't even think about me
Thinking about somebody that doesn't even think about me
Thinking about somebody That doesn't even think about... 
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
Maybe this place is the same...
And we're just changing
Maybe this place is the same...
And we're just changing
I'm driving on state lines pretending you're standing there
But I know your feet will never be where my eyes fall again
Moving on is something I've always had trouble with
But this year I swear I'll get past it
If I had a backyard I would bury all my memories of you in it
Everything that we had would die right down in the dirt
I wish I had the guts to say this to your face
But the past five years took everything I had and ripped it out of me
You used to make me feel like I was something
Now you make me feel like absolutely nothing
I want to fall asleep and wake up four years ago
We were just kids who didn't know what love was
Or what we were digging ourselves into
I want to know if you ever hear 
All of these sad fucking songs I write about you
I wish I had the guts to say this to your face
But the past five years took everything I had and ripped it out of me
You used to make me feel like I was something
Now you make me feel like absolutely nothing
I know you probably hate who I've become
I'm just young and stupid, 
But that's the way I always want to be
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone 
You wouldn't know a good thing even if it slapped the makeup right off of your face
Burn down the bridges just in time for last call
Keep digging yourself neck deep into selfishness
I doubt that you'll ever find out who you really are
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone
Keep falling over that same fucking step on your front porch
Most people learn from their mistakes
But you'll just stay here tripping on the same mistakes
You always do
No one's knocked you off your feet, they say what you want to hear
You're living proof that we don't always get what we deserve
But you're really nothing special
Just another crack in the sidewalk
You never meant anything to me
Or anyone for more than one night
No one's gonna stick around for when you're broken down and blacked out
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone
Keep falling over that same fucking step on your front porch
Most people learn from their mistakes
But you'll just stay here tripping on the same mistakes
You always do
Throw away your early twenties giving up on everyone and everything around you
It never came so easy
Throw away your early twenties giving up on everyone and everything around you
It never came so easy
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone
Keep falling over that same fucking step on your front porch
Most people learn from their mistakes
But you'll just stay here tripping on the same mistakes
You always do
You used to make me feel like I could walk on water
Now most nights I'm just sinking down and down
You're the reason why I can't listen to the same songs I used to
I write songs about you all the time
I bet I don't run through your mind
I've given up on you, but it still hurts to know you're not alone
Don't worry, I'll keep out of your life and stay awake at night
It's 4am and you're keeping me from closing these sleepy eyes
Does the thought of me keep you up at night?
Like the light on the ceiling of your bedroom
Lately, my dog's the only one around that listens to my problems
It's been a lonely year 
I write songs about you all the time
I bet I don't run through your mind
I've given up on you, but it still hurts to know you're not alone
Don't worry, I'll keep out of your life and stay awake at night
With just my skin and bones
It hurts to know you're not alone
I've given up on you, and my skin, and my bones
Spit in my face, tell me I didn't mean what I said
I'll take those words with me when I'm dead
Open your mouth and contradict everything you said last summer
I don't even know you anymore, anymore
You really fucked me up this time for good, even though you didn't mean to
When the weather clears, that sweatshirt weather won't keep you warm like I do
You'll be thinking of my sleepy eyes and bony knees
You'll be thinking of me
Maybe I'll run away from home, fake my own death and see if you really care
A week goes by, I doubt you'll be waiting around for me at all
No matter how many times I walk up my driveway, you won't be there
You're nowhere to be found because everything you said was a lie
You really fucked me up this time for good, even though you didn't mean to
When the weather clears, that sweatshirt weather won't keep you warm like I do
You'll be thinking of my sleepy eyes and bony knees
You'll be thinking of me
You wanted me when I was running away
I needed you when I ripped your heart out
I can't count the times we fell apart
We can't go back, it's not the same
You really fucked me up this time for good, even though you didn't mean to
When the weather clears, that sweatshirt weather won't keep you warm like I do
You'll be thinking of my sleepy eyes and bony knees
You'll be thinking of me
When something's fallen apart as many times as us
I can't put it back together, it's not the same
This time around I wasn't honest enough with how I really felt
I'll spend the winter blending into the streets and sidewalks that make up this town
At least it gave me someone else to write another one of these sad fucking songs about
You're just another sad song to me
I've got this lonely night and Jimmy Eat World
I never had you and you told me I never did
The truth is you won't even be there when I can't stand on my own two feet
You won't be here
I saw right through you on my basement floor
But could you even see past my chest?
Could you ever feel past these hands?
Your intentions were only skin deep
Mine weren't honest enough to fall past my teeth
I've got this lonely night and Jimmy Eat World
I never had you and you told me I never did
The truth is you won't even be there when I can't stand on my own two feet
You won't be here
Will I ever know how it feels to be home again?
I've been told that home is where the heart is
If that's the case, I've never been home 
I've got this lonely night and Jimmy Eat World
I never had you and you told me I never did
The truth is you won't even be there when I can't stand on my own two feet
You won't be here
I've been up spending every late night in my car listening to all these sad songs
I know it sounds weird but they're helping me move past all these things running through my head
I'll blame the Midwest and sleepy eyes
I'm not where I should be
I'm not what I could be
But I'm not who I was
Nostalgia gets the best of me
When I wake up it's the same day
It fucks me up and makes me miss who I used to be
All I have are thoughts of me from back when I was eighteen and my bony knees
Don't want it to be like my teenage years
I was naive and weak back then without much trouble on my shoulders
If I don't break, I won't know how to put myself back together
Nostalgia gets the best of me
When I wake up it's the same day
It fucks me up and makes me miss who I used to be
All I have are thoughts of me from back when I was eighteen and my bony knees
If you never break, you'll never know how 
If you never break, you'll never know 
If you never break, you'll never know how to put yourself back together
Nostalgia gets the best of me
When I wake up it's the same day
It fucks me up and makes me miss who I used to be
All I have are thoughts of me from back when I was eighteen and my bony knees
 

I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed

I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want
Knock me down
I'm not sure I have it in me to get back up
To be who I am seems exhausting anyway
You have a lot in common with my conscience
You both erase my confidence
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Back and forth
Between some kind of vague attachment to yesterday
And never knowing what form of myself I'll get today (to get today)
I'll always be a faded sign in your eyes
No matter what the point of view (point of view)
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
I'm not here
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want to hear
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Would you notice I'm not here
Am I telling myself the truth?
I'm used to pretending to be strong and clueless
Am I doing this right by you?
I seem to be coming off as wrong and ruthless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I changing my mind again?
All this indecision makes me shift my focus
Is the tension my only friend?
Anxiety holds my hand when life gets hopeless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I telling myself the truth about my self-esteem
And how others place their worth in me?
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
(The eyes of someone else)
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
Yeah, I'll keep smiling on the surface
(Am I telling myself the truth?)
"Smiling On The Surface" is the 3rd song released from the album "Composure". It was premiered on June 18, 2018.
Swallowing a feeling
Counting cracks across the ceiling
Never reached the depths of them before
Finding flaws in every format
I know but haven't shown that
I could pick myself up off the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Redefine rock bottom with these empty orange bottles
Never felt so paralysed before (never felt this paralysed)
We're all looking for some answers
With the hangman's broken lantern
Growing ever closer to the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Why do I, why do I, feel so damn cold?
Why am I, why am I, still so low?
Why should I, why should I, get up or get out?
Why should I?
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
Soft spoken, if ever out loud
These days not much gets out
My mind digs graves through the past
But never takes time to finish the act
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
No matter how cold it might get
My bed sheets are laced with regret
I try to fill in the lines
Rework the plans for a better design
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Here I am, bearing every burden
Here I am, showing every worry
To the world
To the world
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try
I'm at best your second option
Like a key under the mat
Are my emotions hard to read?
Seems I'm good at hiding
Reality
You disregard the consequences
Always seem to shift the blame
You burn the bridge and then I build it
Seems you're good at hiding
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
You make me feel helpless
Like a bird with broken wings
Forcing me to be more selfless
Lean on me, don't knock me over
It seems we're good at hiding
It seems we're good at fighting
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
I'm all alone
I feel sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
I'm all alone
I'm feeling sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
(There's nothing I can do)
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
Is there any chance you could cut me some slack?
Because I've been hanging for a while
From this withered rope
Forcing every sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
What could I ask that you help me hold back
Cause I've been falling for a while
Down this fucking slope
Losing any sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
There's a collage of photos framed
Dating '93 to '95
Though all it shows me is that
I'm just a bad seed
Falling off the family tree
I've got more complaints
More than pleasantries to say
Every monument is idly arranged
Every figure that has ever held importance in my life
I find nobody is who I pictured them to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the faces in reflections of the past
I feel so close but I can't reach through the glass
My life burns out and flickers like the end of a cigarette
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the light in your eyes
Turn the blind eye (Turn the blind eye)
"Why are you hurting me" she screamed from her death bed
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
It's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
The tears run down your cheekbones
I feel sorry for you
But I'm too fucking selfish to say I do
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be different
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Today I ripped myself wide open
And I saw that my heart isn't as fucked as I recalled
It's still flawed and
It's sorely stitched to my old ways
I thought it was buried, but it's just stuck
To my old ways
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be something else
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Shaking in the driver's seat
Staring at the dashboard
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
Please just stay
Please just stay
You see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
To take a chance on me
To take a chance
I still see us sitting on that old couch
'Til the sun comes up
Listening to sad songs
We spent our time with smiles on our faces
I know it sounds selfish but I'll miss those days
I know it sounds selfish
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
The Fall leaves flying through the driveway
Keep triggering these memories of you
I'm torn apart with how our lives are changing
I'm sure it sounds selfish, I'm just being honest
I know it sounds selfish
But I'm trying to be honest
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
Let's go back to when thing weren't complicated
Let's go back to all those old dashboard songs
Let's go back to smoking on the side of my old house
We can never go back, we'll never go back
We'll never go back
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
I know it sounds selfish
I'm just being honest
I can't fix everything around me
I can't make everybody happy
And it'll be okay
Show me how to be something other than nostalgic
I want to feel inspired and innocent again
I just want to be worth your time
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Lately when I'm alone I keep thinking about the past
I'm trying to feel weak in my knees again
I want to stand up straight like when I graduated
I just want to be
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Do you remember when you saw right through my selfish skin?
Do you remember when I ignored everything you did?
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
It'll be okay
We rush through our lives
Just to feel some kind of pride
Dismissing actualities is making matters worse
The ink will fade, but won't go away
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
I live in the middle of a lake
And I don't know how to swim
I've isolated everything
Everywhere I go I am consistently alone
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
Cautions only ever made me worry
You know that cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
The patience I once had is running away with my youth
Away in its hands
I've been neglecting who I am
That's just who I was back then
Don't need to be perfect, just happy
I'm still a lost boy
I'm still a lost boy
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
Every once in a while I listen to Death Cab and think about how it used to be 
We thought that we knew the answers
When no one was asking
Asking the questions 
I'm still a lost boy 
I'm still a lost boy 
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
It feels like I've been taking the long way for a while now
Haven't been at home in more years than I care to say
I keep letting my past cover what the present shouldn't be
What I shouldn't be
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
Staring out the window in my bedroom makes me think back
I see me as a boy out there
Lying in the grass
Singing songs with all the wrong notes
And graduating high school as my mom cries
I'm writing the same song over and over again
And feeling lost
I've always felt so lost
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I clenched the wheel the whole way home from Cleveland
With nothing more than my eyes half way open
And my hand smelling like smoke
Each mile I drive gets me closer to the streets that made me feel alone
I'm out of place and it doesn't feel wrong
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I care too much
While you don't even care at all
It's just sad that you don't even care
I walk up the stairs to your apartment and I feel small
The lowest feelings and even lower standards
Pictures of simple times are on the top shelf
You lie to me and say you're happy with the way things are
With the way things are
It's just sad, oh it's sad that you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I spent so much damn time trying to move forward
It hurts me to watch you falling backwards
Brave your life
Finding solutions, not making excuses
Find solutions and stop waiting for excuses
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I care too much, while you don't even care at all
A bit much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different
Don't settle because you're scared
You know I pictured things to be different
I pictured things to be different for you
For you
Could you stay here 'til I fall asleep?
We'll pretend that we could make each other feel complete
I'm looking for something that's not inside of you
Will you think of me when you drive home?
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
Last night I closed my eyes
And thought about someone that wasn't you
The weight of the world slipped off my shoulders
And weighed my back to the floor
It isn't where you want to be
I know this isn't where you want to be
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
You tell me I'm broken
As I stare out my window at the street lights
I walk outside and I sit in the shade at 3am
And I feel whole again
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
And I know we're disconnected
I'm getting pretty good at leaving, my patience isn't wearing thin
Autumn never ends in my head, no matter how far I've been
It feels like everybody is the branch and I'm the leaves
Falling from the top of every leafless tree
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
All I see is the past two years before I hit the ground
Time is moving slower on the way down (on the way down)
Save your time spent wondering what's going through my mind
Let me go before you see me following behind
I'll save you from myself
Just let me go
I'll save you from myself
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
I've learned that it's okay to be selfish
It keeps me from falling apart at the seams
Stuck is where I feel in place
A feeling I'll embrace
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
So much for bad luck
If I built a boat with apologies I've got
I'd have a sorry looking raft
It always rains
But it's nice to see
That someone else is sad
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
The coin's faced up
But I'm not feeling any better
A soap box made for every single fuck up
It's tough seeing where I am
Instead of where I'm from
My roots can get loose
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
Can you find your calling if nothing is calling for you?
I'm coughing up a lung trying to get rid of you
To get rid of you
To get rid of you
Can you find your calling
If nothing's calling for you?
For you?
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
When I heard my parents cry
I realized that we're all lost kids
Trying to find our way home
Blood is thicker than water
And I still feel like everyone I love forgot how to swim
At least there are pictures of my sister and me
Hanging on the wall in my garage
They always give me peace of mind
They always give me peace of mind
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I'm starting to see that
We're always changing
It's just so weird to think that we're always changing
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
I never spent my youth thinking of half the shit I'd go through
Living in the past never helped me
Last night I drove past the house that I grew up in
And tried to find that happiness
Living in the past never helped me
Or anyone move forward
There's no love, no growth for me here
Anymore, anymore
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I know this place is the same and that I'm changing
And I'm just
When I get stopped by a train on my drive home
I don't let it get to me like the rest of the world
I smile and think about how much I've grown over this year
It gives me time to open my mind and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that train
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine without you
I've laid to rest the shit that was always out of my hands
I finally sent all my skeletons away
Like everything I couldn't fix and people I couldn't change
Konstantine always tore me apart and made me cry
Now I hear that song and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that...
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine
Happiness, won't get me over this
Happiness, won't get me over anything, over anything 
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I spend my nights thinking the worst
And telling myself that everything's going to work out
I keep kicking myself in the mouth
Opening up every cut that should be a scar by now
I need the hope I always tell my friends about
I need the hope I always tell my friends about
I sleep with the TV on, it covers up my feelings about the past
Here I am lying awake thinking about how things used to be
I'm sick and tired
I'm sick and tired of being at the same old place in my head
Give me peace of mind
I always backtrack to my old self
When I'm holding on to despair and cracks in my life
I'm holding on when I need to let go
I sleep with the TV on, it covers up my feelings about the past
Here I am lying awake thinking about how things used to be
Doubt is the soil that fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
Doubt is the soil that fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
Doubt is the story of how fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
I'm dirty from head to toe
I'm dirty from head to toe
Change holds me down to the places I don't want to be
When I wake up I look in the mirror and I see
The person that's been scaring me away from moving on
And getting out of my head
I end my nights in the same spot that I told myself I would leave
I want to come home and have it be like it was before I left
I'm starting to see that I keep living alone in the past
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
I can't shake it off
Always a fight between my past,
My head, and my heart, you can cut me up
And spread me all over Illinois
I can't, I can't find myself
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
I'm stuck and I feel like I'm the only one
I end my nights in the same spot that I told myself I would leave
I want to come home and have it be like it was before I left
I'm starting to see that I keep living alone in the past
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
Did I get left behind?
Or is everybody else just hiding that they're lost
Loneliness will never leave my mind
Loneliness will never leave my mind
Did I get left behind?
Or is everybody else just hiding that they're lost
Just when I think I need someone, 
They wrap their arms around my old bones 
And I start breaking apart
I walk away from anyone that cares about me
But I swear my skin's not as rough as I make it out to be
The saddest part is I've been distant since I was sixteen
It keeps me up in bed
I'm stuck here with all the choices I've made 
And the chances I was too afraid to take
I've called myself young and stupid, 
But lately I feel old and desperate
I find it kind of weird how you find yourself 
When you have no one
I look for the right things in all the wrong places
The saddest part is I've been distant since I was sixteen
It keeps me up in bed
I'm stuck here with all the choices I've made 
And the chances I was too afraid to take
I found myself in a late night drives
Without a destination
All I had were thoughts about the past
And a list of my favorite songs to keep me company
But I still struggle and lose myself everyday
I always find myself lost in every line of all these songs
But I felt better when I saw that this is life
And in life were gonna cry
In life were gonna lose sleep
Were gonna feel helpless
But thats how its got to be 
When you lose yourself you'll find what you're looking for
I'm growing past who I used to be
As the night goes on 
I go from feeling out of place to feeling like a ghost
You miss me when I'm gone
But when I'm around it's like I'm hidden behind the paint on the walls
The loneliness will keep me warm tonight
It'll keep me warm seeing as you won't
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more than this
If the open road is my home I'm never leaving
All of the small towns make me throw away my biggest fears
And the big cities make the fucked up stuff feel smaller
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more than this
When I'm not here does anyone miss my secondhand smoke?
Do you wonder where I am or who I'm with?
Call me a mid-twenty sob story
I can't change the way I feel
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more,
Looking for something more
You were easy on my eyes
You were heavy on my heart
I never thought I'd live to see today
You're still in my mind
But not in my chest
I'm a little worn out since you fucking tore me down
You made me believe we had something
I guess that I was wrong
I thought I would be numb to this by now
I guess I was wrong
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
Stick with me or don't stick around at all
I was the boy who was too scared and ran away
I was the glue that never dried
You were the girl that made up her mind
And left me all alone to die
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
I'll sit on my basement floor
Turn off all the lights and try to not think about you
Just know that when I'm down there
I'll know that I won't be running through your mind
You were easy on my eyes
You were heavy on my heart
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
And I'll get through the winter without you
You made me believe we had something
Well I guess that I was wrong
I'm treated like an old book
That was left on the shelf
Everyone underlined what they wanted to read
And forgot the rest
My spine was left worn out and bent
So just take what you want from me
And forget the rest
It really weirds me out 
Because I never thought I'd be where I am today
My bones want to tear out of my skin
This isn't where I want to be
Getting older scares the shit out of me
I'm an old book
It's one of those nights where I'm scared to walk to my basement
These four walls, feel like they're caving in
There's pictures of you and me hidden behind my couch
I'll be waiting for the sun to shine through my window well
Am I trying to forget you or just cover you up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
I used to have an escape
But I ripped the map up a long time ago
So I'll lie to myself and say that I don't care at all
You'll always be hidden in the basement of everything I love
Am I trying to forget you or just cover you up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
The only time that I feel fine
Is when I'm parked in front of my house with tears in my eyes
I find comfort in weakness because it's always there for me
You'll always be hidden in the basement
Of everything I love
Are you trying to forget me or did you cover me up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
I can't believe you've got the nerve to say you love me
Then you left me for dead
I don't love you anymore
I hope you're happy since I don't know you anymore
You were a part of me 
And now you're just nothing but a memory
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
Now I'm just like the pictures that you take
I'm nothing but something that once was
Like colors that fade away in the sunlight
They're nothing special like they used to be
They're gone and they're never coming back
No, they're never coming back
I'm gone and I'm never coming back
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
I woke up today and realized that what we had is dead
I'm just a pile of lifeless bones to you
I've spent too many years thinking about somebody 
That doesn't even think about me
Thinking about somebody that doesn't even think about me
Thinking about somebody That doesn't even think about... 
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
Maybe this place is the same...
And we're just changing
Maybe this place is the same...
And we're just changing
I'm driving on state lines pretending you're standing there
But I know your feet will never be where my eyes fall again
Moving on is something I've always had trouble with
But this year I swear I'll get past it
If I had a backyard I would bury all my memories of you in it
Everything that we had would die right down in the dirt
I wish I had the guts to say this to your face
But the past five years took everything I had and ripped it out of me
You used to make me feel like I was something
Now you make me feel like absolutely nothing
I want to fall asleep and wake up four years ago
We were just kids who didn't know what love was
Or what we were digging ourselves into
I want to know if you ever hear 
All of these sad fucking songs I write about you
I wish I had the guts to say this to your face
But the past five years took everything I had and ripped it out of me
You used to make me feel like I was something
Now you make me feel like absolutely nothing
I know you probably hate who I've become
I'm just young and stupid, 
But that's the way I always want to be
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone 
You wouldn't know a good thing even if it slapped the makeup right off of your face
Burn down the bridges just in time for last call
Keep digging yourself neck deep into selfishness
I doubt that you'll ever find out who you really are
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone
Keep falling over that same fucking step on your front porch
Most people learn from their mistakes
But you'll just stay here tripping on the same mistakes
You always do
No one's knocked you off your feet, they say what you want to hear
You're living proof that we don't always get what we deserve
But you're really nothing special
Just another crack in the sidewalk
You never meant anything to me
Or anyone for more than one night
No one's gonna stick around for when you're broken down and blacked out
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone
Keep falling over that same fucking step on your front porch
Most people learn from their mistakes
But you'll just stay here tripping on the same mistakes
You always do
Throw away your early twenties giving up on everyone and everything around you
It never came so easy
Throw away your early twenties giving up on everyone and everything around you
It never came so easy
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone
Keep falling over that same fucking step on your front porch
Most people learn from their mistakes
But you'll just stay here tripping on the same mistakes
You always do
You used to make me feel like I could walk on water
Now most nights I'm just sinking down and down
You're the reason why I can't listen to the same songs I used to
I write songs about you all the time
I bet I don't run through your mind
I've given up on you, but it still hurts to know you're not alone
Don't worry, I'll keep out of your life and stay awake at night
It's 4am and you're keeping me from closing these sleepy eyes
Does the thought of me keep you up at night?
Like the light on the ceiling of your bedroom
Lately, my dog's the only one around that listens to my problems
It's been a lonely year 
I write songs about you all the time
I bet I don't run through your mind
I've given up on you, but it still hurts to know you're not alone
Don't worry, I'll keep out of your life and stay awake at night
With just my skin and bones
It hurts to know you're not alone
I've given up on you, and my skin, and my bones
Spit in my face, tell me I didn't mean what I said
I'll take those words with me when I'm dead
Open your mouth and contradict everything you said last summer
I don't even know you anymore, anymore
You really fucked me up this time for good, even though you didn't mean to
When the weather clears, that sweatshirt weather won't keep you warm like I do
You'll be thinking of my sleepy eyes and bony knees
You'll be thinking of me
Maybe I'll run away from home, fake my own death and see if you really care
A week goes by, I doubt you'll be waiting around for me at all
No matter how many times I walk up my driveway, you won't be there
You're nowhere to be found because everything you said was a lie
You really fucked me up this time for good, even though you didn't mean to
When the weather clears, that sweatshirt weather won't keep you warm like I do
You'll be thinking of my sleepy eyes and bony knees
You'll be thinking of me
You wanted me when I was running away
I needed you when I ripped your heart out
I can't count the times we fell apart
We can't go back, it's not the same
You really fucked me up this time for good, even though you didn't mean to
When the weather clears, that sweatshirt weather won't keep you warm like I do
You'll be thinking of my sleepy eyes and bony knees
You'll be thinking of me
When something's fallen apart as many times as us
I can't put it back together, it's not the same
This time around I wasn't honest enough with how I really felt
I'll spend the winter blending into the streets and sidewalks that make up this town
At least it gave me someone else to write another one of these sad fucking songs about
You're just another sad song to me
I've got this lonely night and Jimmy Eat World
I never had you and you told me I never did
The truth is you won't even be there when I can't stand on my own two feet
You won't be here
I saw right through you on my basement floor
But could you even see past my chest?
Could you ever feel past these hands?
Your intentions were only skin deep
Mine weren't honest enough to fall past my teeth
I've got this lonely night and Jimmy Eat World
I never had you and you told me I never did
The truth is you won't even be there when I can't stand on my own two feet
You won't be here
Will I ever know how it feels to be home again?
I've been told that home is where the heart is
If that's the case, I've never been home 
I've got this lonely night and Jimmy Eat World
I never had you and you told me I never did
The truth is you won't even be there when I can't stand on my own two feet
You won't be here
I've been up spending every late night in my car listening to all these sad songs
I know it sounds weird but they're helping me move past all these things running through my head
I'll blame the Midwest and sleepy eyes
I'm not where I should be
I'm not what I could be
But I'm not who I was
Nostalgia gets the best of me
When I wake up it's the same day
It fucks me up and makes me miss who I used to be
All I have are thoughts of me from back when I was eighteen and my bony knees
Don't want it to be like my teenage years
I was naive and weak back then without much trouble on my shoulders
If I don't break, I won't know how to put myself back together
Nostalgia gets the best of me
When I wake up it's the same day
It fucks me up and makes me miss who I used to be
All I have are thoughts of me from back when I was eighteen and my bony knees
If you never break, you'll never know how 
If you never break, you'll never know 
If you never break, you'll never know how to put yourself back together
Nostalgia gets the best of me
When I wake up it's the same day
It fucks me up and makes me miss who I used to be
All I have are thoughts of me from back when I was eighteen and my bony knees
Growing up is giving up
I'll sleep sideways on the bed in my moms basement 
It's where I feel at home
You'll sleep with regret and no heart left in your chest
I don't want to end up like you
Your eyes are set on what you'll never have
There's days I feel like a different person 
But I always come back to who I really am 
The American dream is dead, I'm still just a kid
Balancing on the sidewalks of this suburban town
Maybe this year I'll be able to stand up on my feet
Or maybe I'll fall again
I never want to grow out of this skin
That's been dragged through the dirt 
That's what made me find happiness 
My thumbs are broken but I'll take these broken thumbs 
Over your grip on an empty life
Your empty life
 

I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more

"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want
Knock me down
I'm not sure I have it in me to get back up
To be who I am seems exhausting anyway
You have a lot in common with my conscience
You both erase my confidence
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Back and forth
Between some kind of vague attachment to yesterday
And never knowing what form of myself I'll get today (to get today)
I'll always be a faded sign in your eyes
No matter what the point of view (point of view)
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
I'm not here
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want to hear
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Would you notice I'm not here
Am I telling myself the truth?
I'm used to pretending to be strong and clueless
Am I doing this right by you?
I seem to be coming off as wrong and ruthless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I changing my mind again?
All this indecision makes me shift my focus
Is the tension my only friend?
Anxiety holds my hand when life gets hopeless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I telling myself the truth about my self-esteem
And how others place their worth in me?
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
(The eyes of someone else)
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
Yeah, I'll keep smiling on the surface
(Am I telling myself the truth?)
"Smiling On The Surface" is the 3rd song released from the album "Composure". It was premiered on June 18, 2018.
Swallowing a feeling
Counting cracks across the ceiling
Never reached the depths of them before
Finding flaws in every format
I know but haven't shown that
I could pick myself up off the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Redefine rock bottom with these empty orange bottles
Never felt so paralysed before (never felt this paralysed)
We're all looking for some answers
With the hangman's broken lantern
Growing ever closer to the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Why do I, why do I, feel so damn cold?
Why am I, why am I, still so low?
Why should I, why should I, get up or get out?
Why should I?
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
Soft spoken, if ever out loud
These days not much gets out
My mind digs graves through the past
But never takes time to finish the act
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
No matter how cold it might get
My bed sheets are laced with regret
I try to fill in the lines
Rework the plans for a better design
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Here I am, bearing every burden
Here I am, showing every worry
To the world
To the world
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try
I'm at best your second option
Like a key under the mat
Are my emotions hard to read?
Seems I'm good at hiding
Reality
You disregard the consequences
Always seem to shift the blame
You burn the bridge and then I build it
Seems you're good at hiding
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
You make me feel helpless
Like a bird with broken wings
Forcing me to be more selfless
Lean on me, don't knock me over
It seems we're good at hiding
It seems we're good at fighting
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
I'm all alone
I feel sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
I'm all alone
I'm feeling sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
(There's nothing I can do)
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
Is there any chance you could cut me some slack?
Because I've been hanging for a while
From this withered rope
Forcing every sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
What could I ask that you help me hold back
Cause I've been falling for a while
Down this fucking slope
Losing any sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
There's a collage of photos framed
Dating '93 to '95
Though all it shows me is that
I'm just a bad seed
Falling off the family tree
I've got more complaints
More than pleasantries to say
Every monument is idly arranged
Every figure that has ever held importance in my life
I find nobody is who I pictured them to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the faces in reflections of the past
I feel so close but I can't reach through the glass
My life burns out and flickers like the end of a cigarette
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the light in your eyes
Turn the blind eye (Turn the blind eye)
"Why are you hurting me" she screamed from her death bed
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
It's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
The tears run down your cheekbones
I feel sorry for you
But I'm too fucking selfish to say I do
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be different
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Today I ripped myself wide open
And I saw that my heart isn't as fucked as I recalled
It's still flawed and
It's sorely stitched to my old ways
I thought it was buried, but it's just stuck
To my old ways
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be something else
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Shaking in the driver's seat
Staring at the dashboard
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
Please just stay
Please just stay
You see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
To take a chance on me
To take a chance
I still see us sitting on that old couch
'Til the sun comes up
Listening to sad songs
We spent our time with smiles on our faces
I know it sounds selfish but I'll miss those days
I know it sounds selfish
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
The Fall leaves flying through the driveway
Keep triggering these memories of you
I'm torn apart with how our lives are changing
I'm sure it sounds selfish, I'm just being honest
I know it sounds selfish
But I'm trying to be honest
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
Let's go back to when thing weren't complicated
Let's go back to all those old dashboard songs
Let's go back to smoking on the side of my old house
We can never go back, we'll never go back
We'll never go back
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
I know it sounds selfish
I'm just being honest
I can't fix everything around me
I can't make everybody happy
And it'll be okay
Show me how to be something other than nostalgic
I want to feel inspired and innocent again
I just want to be worth your time
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Lately when I'm alone I keep thinking about the past
I'm trying to feel weak in my knees again
I want to stand up straight like when I graduated
I just want to be
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Do you remember when you saw right through my selfish skin?
Do you remember when I ignored everything you did?
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
It'll be okay
We rush through our lives
Just to feel some kind of pride
Dismissing actualities is making matters worse
The ink will fade, but won't go away
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
I live in the middle of a lake
And I don't know how to swim
I've isolated everything
Everywhere I go I am consistently alone
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
Cautions only ever made me worry
You know that cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
The patience I once had is running away with my youth
Away in its hands
I've been neglecting who I am
That's just who I was back then
Don't need to be perfect, just happy
I'm still a lost boy
I'm still a lost boy
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
Every once in a while I listen to Death Cab and think about how it used to be 
We thought that we knew the answers
When no one was asking
Asking the questions 
I'm still a lost boy 
I'm still a lost boy 
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
It feels like I've been taking the long way for a while now
Haven't been at home in more years than I care to say
I keep letting my past cover what the present shouldn't be
What I shouldn't be
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
Staring out the window in my bedroom makes me think back
I see me as a boy out there
Lying in the grass
Singing songs with all the wrong notes
And graduating high school as my mom cries
I'm writing the same song over and over again
And feeling lost
I've always felt so lost
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I clenched the wheel the whole way home from Cleveland
With nothing more than my eyes half way open
And my hand smelling like smoke
Each mile I drive gets me closer to the streets that made me feel alone
I'm out of place and it doesn't feel wrong
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I care too much
While you don't even care at all
It's just sad that you don't even care
I walk up the stairs to your apartment and I feel small
The lowest feelings and even lower standards
Pictures of simple times are on the top shelf
You lie to me and say you're happy with the way things are
With the way things are
It's just sad, oh it's sad that you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I spent so much damn time trying to move forward
It hurts me to watch you falling backwards
Brave your life
Finding solutions, not making excuses
Find solutions and stop waiting for excuses
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I care too much, while you don't even care at all
A bit much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different
Don't settle because you're scared
You know I pictured things to be different
I pictured things to be different for you
For you
Could you stay here 'til I fall asleep?
We'll pretend that we could make each other feel complete
I'm looking for something that's not inside of you
Will you think of me when you drive home?
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
Last night I closed my eyes
And thought about someone that wasn't you
The weight of the world slipped off my shoulders
And weighed my back to the floor
It isn't where you want to be
I know this isn't where you want to be
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
You tell me I'm broken
As I stare out my window at the street lights
I walk outside and I sit in the shade at 3am
And I feel whole again
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
And I know we're disconnected
I'm getting pretty good at leaving, my patience isn't wearing thin
Autumn never ends in my head, no matter how far I've been
It feels like everybody is the branch and I'm the leaves
Falling from the top of every leafless tree
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
All I see is the past two years before I hit the ground
Time is moving slower on the way down (on the way down)
Save your time spent wondering what's going through my mind
Let me go before you see me following behind
I'll save you from myself
Just let me go
I'll save you from myself
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
I've learned that it's okay to be selfish
It keeps me from falling apart at the seams
Stuck is where I feel in place
A feeling I'll embrace
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
So much for bad luck
If I built a boat with apologies I've got
I'd have a sorry looking raft
It always rains
But it's nice to see
That someone else is sad
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
The coin's faced up
But I'm not feeling any better
A soap box made for every single fuck up
It's tough seeing where I am
Instead of where I'm from
My roots can get loose
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
Can you find your calling if nothing is calling for you?
I'm coughing up a lung trying to get rid of you
To get rid of you
To get rid of you
Can you find your calling
If nothing's calling for you?
For you?
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
When I heard my parents cry
I realized that we're all lost kids
Trying to find our way home
Blood is thicker than water
And I still feel like everyone I love forgot how to swim
At least there are pictures of my sister and me
Hanging on the wall in my garage
They always give me peace of mind
They always give me peace of mind
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I'm starting to see that
We're always changing
It's just so weird to think that we're always changing
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
I never spent my youth thinking of half the shit I'd go through
Living in the past never helped me
Last night I drove past the house that I grew up in
And tried to find that happiness
Living in the past never helped me
Or anyone move forward
There's no love, no growth for me here
Anymore, anymore
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I know this place is the same and that I'm changing
And I'm just
When I get stopped by a train on my drive home
I don't let it get to me like the rest of the world
I smile and think about how much I've grown over this year
It gives me time to open my mind and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that train
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine without you
I've laid to rest the shit that was always out of my hands
I finally sent all my skeletons away
Like everything I couldn't fix and people I couldn't change
Konstantine always tore me apart and made me cry
Now I hear that song and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that...
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine
Happiness, won't get me over this
Happiness, won't get me over anything, over anything 
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I spend my nights thinking the worst
And telling myself that everything's going to work out
I keep kicking myself in the mouth
Opening up every cut that should be a scar by now
I need the hope I always tell my friends about
I need the hope I always tell my friends about
I sleep with the TV on, it covers up my feelings about the past
Here I am lying awake thinking about how things used to be
I'm sick and tired
I'm sick and tired of being at the same old place in my head
Give me peace of mind
I always backtrack to my old self
When I'm holding on to despair and cracks in my life
I'm holding on when I need to let go
I sleep with the TV on, it covers up my feelings about the past
Here I am lying awake thinking about how things used to be
Doubt is the soil that fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
Doubt is the soil that fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
Doubt is the story of how fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
I'm dirty from head to toe
I'm dirty from head to toe
Change holds me down to the places I don't want to be
When I wake up I look in the mirror and I see
The person that's been scaring me away from moving on
And getting out of my head
I end my nights in the same spot that I told myself I would leave
I want to come home and have it be like it was before I left
I'm starting to see that I keep living alone in the past
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
I can't shake it off
Always a fight between my past,
My head, and my heart, you can cut me up
And spread me all over Illinois
I can't, I can't find myself
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
I'm stuck and I feel like I'm the only one
I end my nights in the same spot that I told myself I would leave
I want to come home and have it be like it was before I left
I'm starting to see that I keep living alone in the past
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
Did I get left behind?
Or is everybody else just hiding that they're lost
Loneliness will never leave my mind
Loneliness will never leave my mind
Did I get left behind?
Or is everybody else just hiding that they're lost
Just when I think I need someone, 
They wrap their arms around my old bones 
And I start breaking apart
I walk away from anyone that cares about me
But I swear my skin's not as rough as I make it out to be
The saddest part is I've been distant since I was sixteen
It keeps me up in bed
I'm stuck here with all the choices I've made 
And the chances I was too afraid to take
I've called myself young and stupid, 
But lately I feel old and desperate
I find it kind of weird how you find yourself 
When you have no one
I look for the right things in all the wrong places
The saddest part is I've been distant since I was sixteen
It keeps me up in bed
I'm stuck here with all the choices I've made 
And the chances I was too afraid to take
I found myself in a late night drives
Without a destination
All I had were thoughts about the past
And a list of my favorite songs to keep me company
But I still struggle and lose myself everyday
I always find myself lost in every line of all these songs
But I felt better when I saw that this is life
And in life were gonna cry
In life were gonna lose sleep
Were gonna feel helpless
But thats how its got to be 
When you lose yourself you'll find what you're looking for
I'm growing past who I used to be
As the night goes on 
I go from feeling out of place to feeling like a ghost
You miss me when I'm gone
But when I'm around it's like I'm hidden behind the paint on the walls
The loneliness will keep me warm tonight
It'll keep me warm seeing as you won't
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more than this
If the open road is my home I'm never leaving
All of the small towns make me throw away my biggest fears
And the big cities make the fucked up stuff feel smaller
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more than this
When I'm not here does anyone miss my secondhand smoke?
Do you wonder where I am or who I'm with?
Call me a mid-twenty sob story
I can't change the way I feel
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more,
Looking for something more
You were easy on my eyes
You were heavy on my heart
I never thought I'd live to see today
You're still in my mind
But not in my chest
I'm a little worn out since you fucking tore me down
You made me believe we had something
I guess that I was wrong
I thought I would be numb to this by now
I guess I was wrong
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
Stick with me or don't stick around at all
I was the boy who was too scared and ran away
I was the glue that never dried
You were the girl that made up her mind
And left me all alone to die
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
I'll sit on my basement floor
Turn off all the lights and try to not think about you
Just know that when I'm down there
I'll know that I won't be running through your mind
You were easy on my eyes
You were heavy on my heart
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
And I'll get through the winter without you
You made me believe we had something
Well I guess that I was wrong
I'm treated like an old book
That was left on the shelf
Everyone underlined what they wanted to read
And forgot the rest
My spine was left worn out and bent
So just take what you want from me
And forget the rest
It really weirds me out 
Because I never thought I'd be where I am today
My bones want to tear out of my skin
This isn't where I want to be
Getting older scares the shit out of me
I'm an old book
It's one of those nights where I'm scared to walk to my basement
These four walls, feel like they're caving in
There's pictures of you and me hidden behind my couch
I'll be waiting for the sun to shine through my window well
Am I trying to forget you or just cover you up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
I used to have an escape
But I ripped the map up a long time ago
So I'll lie to myself and say that I don't care at all
You'll always be hidden in the basement of everything I love
Am I trying to forget you or just cover you up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
The only time that I feel fine
Is when I'm parked in front of my house with tears in my eyes
I find comfort in weakness because it's always there for me
You'll always be hidden in the basement
Of everything I love
Are you trying to forget me or did you cover me up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
I can't believe you've got the nerve to say you love me
Then you left me for dead
I don't love you anymore
I hope you're happy since I don't know you anymore
You were a part of me 
And now you're just nothing but a memory
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
Now I'm just like the pictures that you take
I'm nothing but something that once was
Like colors that fade away in the sunlight
They're nothing special like they used to be
They're gone and they're never coming back
No, they're never coming back
I'm gone and I'm never coming back
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
I woke up today and realized that what we had is dead
I'm just a pile of lifeless bones to you
I've spent too many years thinking about somebody 
That doesn't even think about me
Thinking about somebody that doesn't even think about me
Thinking about somebody That doesn't even think about... 
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
Maybe this place is the same...
And we're just changing
Maybe this place is the same...
And we're just changing
I'm driving on state lines pretending you're standing there
But I know your feet will never be where my eyes fall again
Moving on is something I've always had trouble with
But this year I swear I'll get past it
If I had a backyard I would bury all my memories of you in it
Everything that we had would die right down in the dirt
I wish I had the guts to say this to your face
But the past five years took everything I had and ripped it out of me
You used to make me feel like I was something
Now you make me feel like absolutely nothing
I want to fall asleep and wake up four years ago
We were just kids who didn't know what love was
Or what we were digging ourselves into
I want to know if you ever hear 
All of these sad fucking songs I write about you
I wish I had the guts to say this to your face
But the past five years took everything I had and ripped it out of me
You used to make me feel like I was something
Now you make me feel like absolutely nothing
I know you probably hate who I've become
I'm just young and stupid, 
But that's the way I always want to be
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone 
You wouldn't know a good thing even if it slapped the makeup right off of your face
Burn down the bridges just in time for last call
Keep digging yourself neck deep into selfishness
I doubt that you'll ever find out who you really are
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone
Keep falling over that same fucking step on your front porch
Most people learn from their mistakes
But you'll just stay here tripping on the same mistakes
You always do
No one's knocked you off your feet, they say what you want to hear
You're living proof that we don't always get what we deserve
But you're really nothing special
Just another crack in the sidewalk
You never meant anything to me
Or anyone for more than one night
No one's gonna stick around for when you're broken down and blacked out
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone
Keep falling over that same fucking step on your front porch
Most people learn from their mistakes
But you'll just stay here tripping on the same mistakes
You always do
Throw away your early twenties giving up on everyone and everything around you
It never came so easy
Throw away your early twenties giving up on everyone and everything around you
It never came so easy
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone
Keep falling over that same fucking step on your front porch
Most people learn from their mistakes
But you'll just stay here tripping on the same mistakes
You always do
You used to make me feel like I could walk on water
Now most nights I'm just sinking down and down
You're the reason why I can't listen to the same songs I used to
I write songs about you all the time
I bet I don't run through your mind
I've given up on you, but it still hurts to know you're not alone
Don't worry, I'll keep out of your life and stay awake at night
It's 4am and you're keeping me from closing these sleepy eyes
Does the thought of me keep you up at night?
Like the light on the ceiling of your bedroom
Lately, my dog's the only one around that listens to my problems
It's been a lonely year 
I write songs about you all the time
I bet I don't run through your mind
I've given up on you, but it still hurts to know you're not alone
Don't worry, I'll keep out of your life and stay awake at night
With just my skin and bones
It hurts to know you're not alone
I've given up on you, and my skin, and my bones
Spit in my face, tell me I didn't mean what I said
I'll take those words with me when I'm dead
Open your mouth and contradict everything you said last summer
I don't even know you anymore, anymore
You really fucked me up this time for good, even though you didn't mean to
When the weather clears, that sweatshirt weather won't keep you warm like I do
You'll be thinking of my sleepy eyes and bony knees
You'll be thinking of me
Maybe I'll run away from home, fake my own death and see if you really care
A week goes by, I doubt you'll be waiting around for me at all
No matter how many times I walk up my driveway, you won't be there
You're nowhere to be found because everything you said was a lie
You really fucked me up this time for good, even though you didn't mean to
When the weather clears, that sweatshirt weather won't keep you warm like I do
You'll be thinking of my sleepy eyes and bony knees
You'll be thinking of me
You wanted me when I was running away
I needed you when I ripped your heart out
I can't count the times we fell apart
We can't go back, it's not the same
You really fucked me up this time for good, even though you didn't mean to
When the weather clears, that sweatshirt weather won't keep you warm like I do
You'll be thinking of my sleepy eyes and bony knees
You'll be thinking of me
When something's fallen apart as many times as us
I can't put it back together, it's not the same
This time around I wasn't honest enough with how I really felt
I'll spend the winter blending into the streets and sidewalks that make up this town
At least it gave me someone else to write another one of these sad fucking songs about
You're just another sad song to me
I've got this lonely night and Jimmy Eat World
I never had you and you told me I never did
The truth is you won't even be there when I can't stand on my own two feet
You won't be here
I saw right through you on my basement floor
But could you even see past my chest?
Could you ever feel past these hands?
Your intentions were only skin deep
Mine weren't honest enough to fall past my teeth
I've got this lonely night and Jimmy Eat World
I never had you and you told me I never did
The truth is you won't even be there when I can't stand on my own two feet
You won't be here
Will I ever know how it feels to be home again?
I've been told that home is where the heart is
If that's the case, I've never been home 
I've got this lonely night and Jimmy Eat World
I never had you and you told me I never did
The truth is you won't even be there when I can't stand on my own two feet
You won't be here
I've been up spending every late night in my car listening to all these sad songs
I know it sounds weird but they're helping me move past all these things running through my head
I'll blame the Midwest and sleepy eyes
I'm not where I should be
I'm not what I could be
But I'm not who I was
Nostalgia gets the best of me
When I wake up it's the same day
It fucks me up and makes me miss who I used to be
All I have are thoughts of me from back when I was eighteen and my bony knees
Don't want it to be like my teenage years
I was naive and weak back then without much trouble on my shoulders
If I don't break, I won't know how to put myself back together
Nostalgia gets the best of me
When I wake up it's the same day
It fucks me up and makes me miss who I used to be
All I have are thoughts of me from back when I was eighteen and my bony knees
If you never break, you'll never know how 
If you never break, you'll never know 
If you never break, you'll never know how to put yourself back together
Nostalgia gets the best of me
When I wake up it's the same day
It fucks me up and makes me miss who I used to be
All I have are thoughts of me from back when I was eighteen and my bony knees
Growing up is giving up
I'll sleep sideways on the bed in my moms basement 
It's where I feel at home
You'll sleep with regret and no heart left in your chest
I don't want to end up like you
Your eyes are set on what you'll never have
There's days I feel like a different person 
But I always come back to who I really am 
The American dream is dead, I'm still just a kid
Balancing on the sidewalks of this suburban town
Maybe this year I'll be able to stand up on my feet
Or maybe I'll fall again
I never want to grow out of this skin
That's been dragged through the dirt 
That's what made me find happiness 
My thumbs are broken but I'll take these broken thumbs 
Over your grip on an empty life
Your empty life
I've spent the end of my summer
Listening to these songs I know you don't like
I've been wondering where you are and who you're with
We used to lay on your kitchen floor at two a.m.
I was forty miles away from my house but I never felt so at home
I was forty miles away from my house 
You never called before you left to move west
I was just dead weight pulling you down
I'll move forward without the person I need
When somethings fallen apart as many times as us
I can't put it back together it's not the same
You still run through my head every night
When I lay in bed
You used to cover up the cigarette burn on the passenger seat
of my car
Now there's just empty coffee cups 
And long drives by myself
 

I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm

When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want
Knock me down
I'm not sure I have it in me to get back up
To be who I am seems exhausting anyway
You have a lot in common with my conscience
You both erase my confidence
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Back and forth
Between some kind of vague attachment to yesterday
And never knowing what form of myself I'll get today (to get today)
I'll always be a faded sign in your eyes
No matter what the point of view (point of view)
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
I'm not here
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want to hear
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Would you notice I'm not here
Am I telling myself the truth?
I'm used to pretending to be strong and clueless
Am I doing this right by you?
I seem to be coming off as wrong and ruthless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I changing my mind again?
All this indecision makes me shift my focus
Is the tension my only friend?
Anxiety holds my hand when life gets hopeless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I telling myself the truth about my self-esteem
And how others place their worth in me?
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
(The eyes of someone else)
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
Yeah, I'll keep smiling on the surface
(Am I telling myself the truth?)
"Smiling On The Surface" is the 3rd song released from the album "Composure". It was premiered on June 18, 2018.
Swallowing a feeling
Counting cracks across the ceiling
Never reached the depths of them before
Finding flaws in every format
I know but haven't shown that
I could pick myself up off the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Redefine rock bottom with these empty orange bottles
Never felt so paralysed before (never felt this paralysed)
We're all looking for some answers
With the hangman's broken lantern
Growing ever closer to the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Why do I, why do I, feel so damn cold?
Why am I, why am I, still so low?
Why should I, why should I, get up or get out?
Why should I?
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
Soft spoken, if ever out loud
These days not much gets out
My mind digs graves through the past
But never takes time to finish the act
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
No matter how cold it might get
My bed sheets are laced with regret
I try to fill in the lines
Rework the plans for a better design
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Here I am, bearing every burden
Here I am, showing every worry
To the world
To the world
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try
I'm at best your second option
Like a key under the mat
Are my emotions hard to read?
Seems I'm good at hiding
Reality
You disregard the consequences
Always seem to shift the blame
You burn the bridge and then I build it
Seems you're good at hiding
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
You make me feel helpless
Like a bird with broken wings
Forcing me to be more selfless
Lean on me, don't knock me over
It seems we're good at hiding
It seems we're good at fighting
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
I'm all alone
I feel sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
I'm all alone
I'm feeling sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
(There's nothing I can do)
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
Is there any chance you could cut me some slack?
Because I've been hanging for a while
From this withered rope
Forcing every sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
What could I ask that you help me hold back
Cause I've been falling for a while
Down this fucking slope
Losing any sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
There's a collage of photos framed
Dating '93 to '95
Though all it shows me is that
I'm just a bad seed
Falling off the family tree
I've got more complaints
More than pleasantries to say
Every monument is idly arranged
Every figure that has ever held importance in my life
I find nobody is who I pictured them to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the faces in reflections of the past
I feel so close but I can't reach through the glass
My life burns out and flickers like the end of a cigarette
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the light in your eyes
Turn the blind eye (Turn the blind eye)
"Why are you hurting me" she screamed from her death bed
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
It's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
The tears run down your cheekbones
I feel sorry for you
But I'm too fucking selfish to say I do
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be different
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Today I ripped myself wide open
And I saw that my heart isn't as fucked as I recalled
It's still flawed and
It's sorely stitched to my old ways
I thought it was buried, but it's just stuck
To my old ways
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be something else
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Shaking in the driver's seat
Staring at the dashboard
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
Please just stay
Please just stay
You see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
To take a chance on me
To take a chance
I still see us sitting on that old couch
'Til the sun comes up
Listening to sad songs
We spent our time with smiles on our faces
I know it sounds selfish but I'll miss those days
I know it sounds selfish
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
The Fall leaves flying through the driveway
Keep triggering these memories of you
I'm torn apart with how our lives are changing
I'm sure it sounds selfish, I'm just being honest
I know it sounds selfish
But I'm trying to be honest
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
Let's go back to when thing weren't complicated
Let's go back to all those old dashboard songs
Let's go back to smoking on the side of my old house
We can never go back, we'll never go back
We'll never go back
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
I know it sounds selfish
I'm just being honest
I can't fix everything around me
I can't make everybody happy
And it'll be okay
Show me how to be something other than nostalgic
I want to feel inspired and innocent again
I just want to be worth your time
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Lately when I'm alone I keep thinking about the past
I'm trying to feel weak in my knees again
I want to stand up straight like when I graduated
I just want to be
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Do you remember when you saw right through my selfish skin?
Do you remember when I ignored everything you did?
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
It'll be okay
We rush through our lives
Just to feel some kind of pride
Dismissing actualities is making matters worse
The ink will fade, but won't go away
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
I live in the middle of a lake
And I don't know how to swim
I've isolated everything
Everywhere I go I am consistently alone
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
Cautions only ever made me worry
You know that cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
The patience I once had is running away with my youth
Away in its hands
I've been neglecting who I am
That's just who I was back then
Don't need to be perfect, just happy
I'm still a lost boy
I'm still a lost boy
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
Every once in a while I listen to Death Cab and think about how it used to be 
We thought that we knew the answers
When no one was asking
Asking the questions 
I'm still a lost boy 
I'm still a lost boy 
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
It feels like I've been taking the long way for a while now
Haven't been at home in more years than I care to say
I keep letting my past cover what the present shouldn't be
What I shouldn't be
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
Staring out the window in my bedroom makes me think back
I see me as a boy out there
Lying in the grass
Singing songs with all the wrong notes
And graduating high school as my mom cries
I'm writing the same song over and over again
And feeling lost
I've always felt so lost
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I clenched the wheel the whole way home from Cleveland
With nothing more than my eyes half way open
And my hand smelling like smoke
Each mile I drive gets me closer to the streets that made me feel alone
I'm out of place and it doesn't feel wrong
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I care too much
While you don't even care at all
It's just sad that you don't even care
I walk up the stairs to your apartment and I feel small
The lowest feelings and even lower standards
Pictures of simple times are on the top shelf
You lie to me and say you're happy with the way things are
With the way things are
It's just sad, oh it's sad that you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I spent so much damn time trying to move forward
It hurts me to watch you falling backwards
Brave your life
Finding solutions, not making excuses
Find solutions and stop waiting for excuses
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I care too much, while you don't even care at all
A bit much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different
Don't settle because you're scared
You know I pictured things to be different
I pictured things to be different for you
For you
Could you stay here 'til I fall asleep?
We'll pretend that we could make each other feel complete
I'm looking for something that's not inside of you
Will you think of me when you drive home?
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
Last night I closed my eyes
And thought about someone that wasn't you
The weight of the world slipped off my shoulders
And weighed my back to the floor
It isn't where you want to be
I know this isn't where you want to be
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
You tell me I'm broken
As I stare out my window at the street lights
I walk outside and I sit in the shade at 3am
And I feel whole again
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
And I know we're disconnected
I'm getting pretty good at leaving, my patience isn't wearing thin
Autumn never ends in my head, no matter how far I've been
It feels like everybody is the branch and I'm the leaves
Falling from the top of every leafless tree
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
All I see is the past two years before I hit the ground
Time is moving slower on the way down (on the way down)
Save your time spent wondering what's going through my mind
Let me go before you see me following behind
I'll save you from myself
Just let me go
I'll save you from myself
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
I've learned that it's okay to be selfish
It keeps me from falling apart at the seams
Stuck is where I feel in place
A feeling I'll embrace
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
So much for bad luck
If I built a boat with apologies I've got
I'd have a sorry looking raft
It always rains
But it's nice to see
That someone else is sad
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
The coin's faced up
But I'm not feeling any better
A soap box made for every single fuck up
It's tough seeing where I am
Instead of where I'm from
My roots can get loose
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
Can you find your calling if nothing is calling for you?
I'm coughing up a lung trying to get rid of you
To get rid of you
To get rid of you
Can you find your calling
If nothing's calling for you?
For you?
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
When I heard my parents cry
I realized that we're all lost kids
Trying to find our way home
Blood is thicker than water
And I still feel like everyone I love forgot how to swim
At least there are pictures of my sister and me
Hanging on the wall in my garage
They always give me peace of mind
They always give me peace of mind
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I'm starting to see that
We're always changing
It's just so weird to think that we're always changing
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
I never spent my youth thinking of half the shit I'd go through
Living in the past never helped me
Last night I drove past the house that I grew up in
And tried to find that happiness
Living in the past never helped me
Or anyone move forward
There's no love, no growth for me here
Anymore, anymore
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I know this place is the same and that I'm changing
And I'm just
When I get stopped by a train on my drive home
I don't let it get to me like the rest of the world
I smile and think about how much I've grown over this year
It gives me time to open my mind and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that train
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine without you
I've laid to rest the shit that was always out of my hands
I finally sent all my skeletons away
Like everything I couldn't fix and people I couldn't change
Konstantine always tore me apart and made me cry
Now I hear that song and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that...
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine
Happiness, won't get me over this
Happiness, won't get me over anything, over anything 
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I spend my nights thinking the worst
And telling myself that everything's going to work out
I keep kicking myself in the mouth
Opening up every cut that should be a scar by now
I need the hope I always tell my friends about
I need the hope I always tell my friends about
I sleep with the TV on, it covers up my feelings about the past
Here I am lying awake thinking about how things used to be
I'm sick and tired
I'm sick and tired of being at the same old place in my head
Give me peace of mind
I always backtrack to my old self
When I'm holding on to despair and cracks in my life
I'm holding on when I need to let go
I sleep with the TV on, it covers up my feelings about the past
Here I am lying awake thinking about how things used to be
Doubt is the soil that fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
Doubt is the soil that fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
Doubt is the story of how fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
I'm dirty from head to toe
I'm dirty from head to toe
Change holds me down to the places I don't want to be
When I wake up I look in the mirror and I see
The person that's been scaring me away from moving on
And getting out of my head
I end my nights in the same spot that I told myself I would leave
I want to come home and have it be like it was before I left
I'm starting to see that I keep living alone in the past
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
I can't shake it off
Always a fight between my past,
My head, and my heart, you can cut me up
And spread me all over Illinois
I can't, I can't find myself
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
I'm stuck and I feel like I'm the only one
I end my nights in the same spot that I told myself I would leave
I want to come home and have it be like it was before I left
I'm starting to see that I keep living alone in the past
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
Did I get left behind?
Or is everybody else just hiding that they're lost
Loneliness will never leave my mind
Loneliness will never leave my mind
Did I get left behind?
Or is everybody else just hiding that they're lost
Just when I think I need someone, 
They wrap their arms around my old bones 
And I start breaking apart
I walk away from anyone that cares about me
But I swear my skin's not as rough as I make it out to be
The saddest part is I've been distant since I was sixteen
It keeps me up in bed
I'm stuck here with all the choices I've made 
And the chances I was too afraid to take
I've called myself young and stupid, 
But lately I feel old and desperate
I find it kind of weird how you find yourself 
When you have no one
I look for the right things in all the wrong places
The saddest part is I've been distant since I was sixteen
It keeps me up in bed
I'm stuck here with all the choices I've made 
And the chances I was too afraid to take
I found myself in a late night drives
Without a destination
All I had were thoughts about the past
And a list of my favorite songs to keep me company
But I still struggle and lose myself everyday
I always find myself lost in every line of all these songs
But I felt better when I saw that this is life
And in life were gonna cry
In life were gonna lose sleep
Were gonna feel helpless
But thats how its got to be 
When you lose yourself you'll find what you're looking for
I'm growing past who I used to be
As the night goes on 
I go from feeling out of place to feeling like a ghost
You miss me when I'm gone
But when I'm around it's like I'm hidden behind the paint on the walls
The loneliness will keep me warm tonight
It'll keep me warm seeing as you won't
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more than this
If the open road is my home I'm never leaving
All of the small towns make me throw away my biggest fears
And the big cities make the fucked up stuff feel smaller
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more than this
When I'm not here does anyone miss my secondhand smoke?
Do you wonder where I am or who I'm with?
Call me a mid-twenty sob story
I can't change the way I feel
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more,
Looking for something more
You were easy on my eyes
You were heavy on my heart
I never thought I'd live to see today
You're still in my mind
But not in my chest
I'm a little worn out since you fucking tore me down
You made me believe we had something
I guess that I was wrong
I thought I would be numb to this by now
I guess I was wrong
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
Stick with me or don't stick around at all
I was the boy who was too scared and ran away
I was the glue that never dried
You were the girl that made up her mind
And left me all alone to die
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
I'll sit on my basement floor
Turn off all the lights and try to not think about you
Just know that when I'm down there
I'll know that I won't be running through your mind
You were easy on my eyes
You were heavy on my heart
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
And I'll get through the winter without you
You made me believe we had something
Well I guess that I was wrong
I'm treated like an old book
That was left on the shelf
Everyone underlined what they wanted to read
And forgot the rest
My spine was left worn out and bent
So just take what you want from me
And forget the rest
It really weirds me out 
Because I never thought I'd be where I am today
My bones want to tear out of my skin
This isn't where I want to be
Getting older scares the shit out of me
I'm an old book
It's one of those nights where I'm scared to walk to my basement
These four walls, feel like they're caving in
There's pictures of you and me hidden behind my couch
I'll be waiting for the sun to shine through my window well
Am I trying to forget you or just cover you up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
I used to have an escape
But I ripped the map up a long time ago
So I'll lie to myself and say that I don't care at all
You'll always be hidden in the basement of everything I love
Am I trying to forget you or just cover you up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
The only time that I feel fine
Is when I'm parked in front of my house with tears in my eyes
I find comfort in weakness because it's always there for me
You'll always be hidden in the basement
Of everything I love
Are you trying to forget me or did you cover me up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
I can't believe you've got the nerve to say you love me
Then you left me for dead
I don't love you anymore
I hope you're happy since I don't know you anymore
You were a part of me 
And now you're just nothing but a memory
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
Now I'm just like the pictures that you take
I'm nothing but something that once was
Like colors that fade away in the sunlight
They're nothing special like they used to be
They're gone and they're never coming back
No, they're never coming back
I'm gone and I'm never coming back
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
I woke up today and realized that what we had is dead
I'm just a pile of lifeless bones to you
I've spent too many years thinking about somebody 
That doesn't even think about me
Thinking about somebody that doesn't even think about me
Thinking about somebody That doesn't even think about... 
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
Maybe this place is the same...
And we're just changing
Maybe this place is the same...
And we're just changing
I'm driving on state lines pretending you're standing there
But I know your feet will never be where my eyes fall again
Moving on is something I've always had trouble with
But this year I swear I'll get past it
If I had a backyard I would bury all my memories of you in it
Everything that we had would die right down in the dirt
I wish I had the guts to say this to your face
But the past five years took everything I had and ripped it out of me
You used to make me feel like I was something
Now you make me feel like absolutely nothing
I want to fall asleep and wake up four years ago
We were just kids who didn't know what love was
Or what we were digging ourselves into
I want to know if you ever hear 
All of these sad fucking songs I write about you
I wish I had the guts to say this to your face
But the past five years took everything I had and ripped it out of me
You used to make me feel like I was something
Now you make me feel like absolutely nothing
I know you probably hate who I've become
I'm just young and stupid, 
But that's the way I always want to be
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone 
You wouldn't know a good thing even if it slapped the makeup right off of your face
Burn down the bridges just in time for last call
Keep digging yourself neck deep into selfishness
I doubt that you'll ever find out who you really are
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone
Keep falling over that same fucking step on your front porch
Most people learn from their mistakes
But you'll just stay here tripping on the same mistakes
You always do
No one's knocked you off your feet, they say what you want to hear
You're living proof that we don't always get what we deserve
But you're really nothing special
Just another crack in the sidewalk
You never meant anything to me
Or anyone for more than one night
No one's gonna stick around for when you're broken down and blacked out
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone
Keep falling over that same fucking step on your front porch
Most people learn from their mistakes
But you'll just stay here tripping on the same mistakes
You always do
Throw away your early twenties giving up on everyone and everything around you
It never came so easy
Throw away your early twenties giving up on everyone and everything around you
It never came so easy
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone
Keep falling over that same fucking step on your front porch
Most people learn from their mistakes
But you'll just stay here tripping on the same mistakes
You always do
You used to make me feel like I could walk on water
Now most nights I'm just sinking down and down
You're the reason why I can't listen to the same songs I used to
I write songs about you all the time
I bet I don't run through your mind
I've given up on you, but it still hurts to know you're not alone
Don't worry, I'll keep out of your life and stay awake at night
It's 4am and you're keeping me from closing these sleepy eyes
Does the thought of me keep you up at night?
Like the light on the ceiling of your bedroom
Lately, my dog's the only one around that listens to my problems
It's been a lonely year 
I write songs about you all the time
I bet I don't run through your mind
I've given up on you, but it still hurts to know you're not alone
Don't worry, I'll keep out of your life and stay awake at night
With just my skin and bones
It hurts to know you're not alone
I've given up on you, and my skin, and my bones
Spit in my face, tell me I didn't mean what I said
I'll take those words with me when I'm dead
Open your mouth and contradict everything you said last summer
I don't even know you anymore, anymore
You really fucked me up this time for good, even though you didn't mean to
When the weather clears, that sweatshirt weather won't keep you warm like I do
You'll be thinking of my sleepy eyes and bony knees
You'll be thinking of me
Maybe I'll run away from home, fake my own death and see if you really care
A week goes by, I doubt you'll be waiting around for me at all
No matter how many times I walk up my driveway, you won't be there
You're nowhere to be found because everything you said was a lie
You really fucked me up this time for good, even though you didn't mean to
When the weather clears, that sweatshirt weather won't keep you warm like I do
You'll be thinking of my sleepy eyes and bony knees
You'll be thinking of me
You wanted me when I was running away
I needed you when I ripped your heart out
I can't count the times we fell apart
We can't go back, it's not the same
You really fucked me up this time for good, even though you didn't mean to
When the weather clears, that sweatshirt weather won't keep you warm like I do
You'll be thinking of my sleepy eyes and bony knees
You'll be thinking of me
When something's fallen apart as many times as us
I can't put it back together, it's not the same
This time around I wasn't honest enough with how I really felt
I'll spend the winter blending into the streets and sidewalks that make up this town
At least it gave me someone else to write another one of these sad fucking songs about
You're just another sad song to me
I've got this lonely night and Jimmy Eat World
I never had you and you told me I never did
The truth is you won't even be there when I can't stand on my own two feet
You won't be here
I saw right through you on my basement floor
But could you even see past my chest?
Could you ever feel past these hands?
Your intentions were only skin deep
Mine weren't honest enough to fall past my teeth
I've got this lonely night and Jimmy Eat World
I never had you and you told me I never did
The truth is you won't even be there when I can't stand on my own two feet
You won't be here
Will I ever know how it feels to be home again?
I've been told that home is where the heart is
If that's the case, I've never been home 
I've got this lonely night and Jimmy Eat World
I never had you and you told me I never did
The truth is you won't even be there when I can't stand on my own two feet
You won't be here
I've been up spending every late night in my car listening to all these sad songs
I know it sounds weird but they're helping me move past all these things running through my head
I'll blame the Midwest and sleepy eyes
I'm not where I should be
I'm not what I could be
But I'm not who I was
Nostalgia gets the best of me
When I wake up it's the same day
It fucks me up and makes me miss who I used to be
All I have are thoughts of me from back when I was eighteen and my bony knees
Don't want it to be like my teenage years
I was naive and weak back then without much trouble on my shoulders
If I don't break, I won't know how to put myself back together
Nostalgia gets the best of me
When I wake up it's the same day
It fucks me up and makes me miss who I used to be
All I have are thoughts of me from back when I was eighteen and my bony knees
If you never break, you'll never know how 
If you never break, you'll never know 
If you never break, you'll never know how to put yourself back together
Nostalgia gets the best of me
When I wake up it's the same day
It fucks me up and makes me miss who I used to be
All I have are thoughts of me from back when I was eighteen and my bony knees
Growing up is giving up
I'll sleep sideways on the bed in my moms basement 
It's where I feel at home
You'll sleep with regret and no heart left in your chest
I don't want to end up like you
Your eyes are set on what you'll never have
There's days I feel like a different person 
But I always come back to who I really am 
The American dream is dead, I'm still just a kid
Balancing on the sidewalks of this suburban town
Maybe this year I'll be able to stand up on my feet
Or maybe I'll fall again
I never want to grow out of this skin
That's been dragged through the dirt 
That's what made me find happiness 
My thumbs are broken but I'll take these broken thumbs 
Over your grip on an empty life
Your empty life
I've spent the end of my summer
Listening to these songs I know you don't like
I've been wondering where you are and who you're with
We used to lay on your kitchen floor at two a.m.
I was forty miles away from my house but I never felt so at home
I was forty miles away from my house 
You never called before you left to move west
I was just dead weight pulling you down
I'll move forward without the person I need
When somethings fallen apart as many times as us
I can't put it back together it's not the same
You still run through my head every night
When I lay in bed
You used to cover up the cigarette burn on the passenger seat
of my car
Now there's just empty coffee cups 
And long drives by myself
If you wore your personality on your skin, no one would take a second look
You were shallow when we met and you still are
The water won't be coming down anytime soon to change that
Loneliness keeps me warm at night and that's okay with me
I'd rather be alone in this bed made for two than listen to you and your judgement
Don't act like you're better than me
We're both fools lost in this cold world
You might not fall as much as I do, but if I look close enough I can find the scars on your knees
I can find the bags under your eyes that carry too much for you to handle
I'm starting to think that you're the reason why everyone left
So stop pointing your finger
You don't even really know me, not at all
You don't even really know me
Don't act like you're better than me
We're both fools lost in this cold world
You might not fall as much as I do, but if I look close enough I can find the scars on your knees
I can find the bags under your eyes that carry too much for you to handle
I said I'm selfish, I'm a liar and I'm broken
Shit runs through my head every day that I would never tell anyone
You're just like me
The only difference is that I'm honest enough to scream my flaws in the lines of this song
 

I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me

It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go

My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go

"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want
Knock me down
I'm not sure I have it in me to get back up
To be who I am seems exhausting anyway
You have a lot in common with my conscience
You both erase my confidence
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Back and forth
Between some kind of vague attachment to yesterday
And never knowing what form of myself I'll get today (to get today)
I'll always be a faded sign in your eyes
No matter what the point of view (point of view)
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
I'm not here
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want to hear
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Would you notice I'm not here
Am I telling myself the truth?
I'm used to pretending to be strong and clueless
Am I doing this right by you?
I seem to be coming off as wrong and ruthless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I changing my mind again?
All this indecision makes me shift my focus
Is the tension my only friend?
Anxiety holds my hand when life gets hopeless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I telling myself the truth about my self-esteem
And how others place their worth in me?
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
(The eyes of someone else)
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
Yeah, I'll keep smiling on the surface
(Am I telling myself the truth?)
"Smiling On The Surface" is the 3rd song released from the album "Composure". It was premiered on June 18, 2018.
Swallowing a feeling
Counting cracks across the ceiling
Never reached the depths of them before
Finding flaws in every format
I know but haven't shown that
I could pick myself up off the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Redefine rock bottom with these empty orange bottles
Never felt so paralysed before (never felt this paralysed)
We're all looking for some answers
With the hangman's broken lantern
Growing ever closer to the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Why do I, why do I, feel so damn cold?
Why am I, why am I, still so low?
Why should I, why should I, get up or get out?
Why should I?
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
Soft spoken, if ever out loud
These days not much gets out
My mind digs graves through the past
But never takes time to finish the act
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
No matter how cold it might get
My bed sheets are laced with regret
I try to fill in the lines
Rework the plans for a better design
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Here I am, bearing every burden
Here I am, showing every worry
To the world
To the world
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try
I'm at best your second option
Like a key under the mat
Are my emotions hard to read?
Seems I'm good at hiding
Reality
You disregard the consequences
Always seem to shift the blame
You burn the bridge and then I build it
Seems you're good at hiding
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
You make me feel helpless
Like a bird with broken wings
Forcing me to be more selfless
Lean on me, don't knock me over
It seems we're good at hiding
It seems we're good at fighting
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
I'm all alone
I feel sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
I'm all alone
I'm feeling sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
(There's nothing I can do)
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
Is there any chance you could cut me some slack?
Because I've been hanging for a while
From this withered rope
Forcing every sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
What could I ask that you help me hold back
Cause I've been falling for a while
Down this fucking slope
Losing any sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
There's a collage of photos framed
Dating '93 to '95
Though all it shows me is that
I'm just a bad seed
Falling off the family tree
I've got more complaints
More than pleasantries to say
Every monument is idly arranged
Every figure that has ever held importance in my life
I find nobody is who I pictured them to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the faces in reflections of the past
I feel so close but I can't reach through the glass
My life burns out and flickers like the end of a cigarette
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the light in your eyes
Turn the blind eye (Turn the blind eye)
"Why are you hurting me" she screamed from her death bed
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
It's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
The tears run down your cheekbones
I feel sorry for you
But I'm too fucking selfish to say I do
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be different
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Today I ripped myself wide open
And I saw that my heart isn't as fucked as I recalled
It's still flawed and
It's sorely stitched to my old ways
I thought it was buried, but it's just stuck
To my old ways
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be something else
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Shaking in the driver's seat
Staring at the dashboard
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
Please just stay
Please just stay
You see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
To take a chance on me
To take a chance
I still see us sitting on that old couch
'Til the sun comes up
Listening to sad songs
We spent our time with smiles on our faces
I know it sounds selfish but I'll miss those days
I know it sounds selfish
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
The Fall leaves flying through the driveway
Keep triggering these memories of you
I'm torn apart with how our lives are changing
I'm sure it sounds selfish, I'm just being honest
I know it sounds selfish
But I'm trying to be honest
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
Let's go back to when thing weren't complicated
Let's go back to all those old dashboard songs
Let's go back to smoking on the side of my old house
We can never go back, we'll never go back
We'll never go back
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
I know it sounds selfish
I'm just being honest
I can't fix everything around me
I can't make everybody happy
And it'll be okay
Show me how to be something other than nostalgic
I want to feel inspired and innocent again
I just want to be worth your time
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Lately when I'm alone I keep thinking about the past
I'm trying to feel weak in my knees again
I want to stand up straight like when I graduated
I just want to be
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Do you remember when you saw right through my selfish skin?
Do you remember when I ignored everything you did?
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
It'll be okay
We rush through our lives
Just to feel some kind of pride
Dismissing actualities is making matters worse
The ink will fade, but won't go away
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
I live in the middle of a lake
And I don't know how to swim
I've isolated everything
Everywhere I go I am consistently alone
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
Cautions only ever made me worry
You know that cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
The patience I once had is running away with my youth
Away in its hands
I've been neglecting who I am
That's just who I was back then
Don't need to be perfect, just happy
I'm still a lost boy
I'm still a lost boy
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
Every once in a while I listen to Death Cab and think about how it used to be 
We thought that we knew the answers
When no one was asking
Asking the questions 
I'm still a lost boy 
I'm still a lost boy 
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
It feels like I've been taking the long way for a while now
Haven't been at home in more years than I care to say
I keep letting my past cover what the present shouldn't be
What I shouldn't be
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
Staring out the window in my bedroom makes me think back
I see me as a boy out there
Lying in the grass
Singing songs with all the wrong notes
And graduating high school as my mom cries
I'm writing the same song over and over again
And feeling lost
I've always felt so lost
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I clenched the wheel the whole way home from Cleveland
With nothing more than my eyes half way open
And my hand smelling like smoke
Each mile I drive gets me closer to the streets that made me feel alone
I'm out of place and it doesn't feel wrong
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I care too much
While you don't even care at all
It's just sad that you don't even care
I walk up the stairs to your apartment and I feel small
The lowest feelings and even lower standards
Pictures of simple times are on the top shelf
You lie to me and say you're happy with the way things are
With the way things are
It's just sad, oh it's sad that you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I spent so much damn time trying to move forward
It hurts me to watch you falling backwards
Brave your life
Finding solutions, not making excuses
Find solutions and stop waiting for excuses
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I care too much, while you don't even care at all
A bit much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different
Don't settle because you're scared
You know I pictured things to be different
I pictured things to be different for you
For you
Could you stay here 'til I fall asleep?
We'll pretend that we could make each other feel complete
I'm looking for something that's not inside of you
Will you think of me when you drive home?
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
Last night I closed my eyes
And thought about someone that wasn't you
The weight of the world slipped off my shoulders
And weighed my back to the floor
It isn't where you want to be
I know this isn't where you want to be
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
You tell me I'm broken
As I stare out my window at the street lights
I walk outside and I sit in the shade at 3am
And I feel whole again
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
And I know we're disconnected
I'm getting pretty good at leaving, my patience isn't wearing thin
Autumn never ends in my head, no matter how far I've been
It feels like everybody is the branch and I'm the leaves
Falling from the top of every leafless tree
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
All I see is the past two years before I hit the ground
Time is moving slower on the way down (on the way down)
Save your time spent wondering what's going through my mind
Let me go before you see me following behind
I'll save you from myself
Just let me go
I'll save you from myself
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
I've learned that it's okay to be selfish
It keeps me from falling apart at the seams
Stuck is where I feel in place
A feeling I'll embrace
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
So much for bad luck
If I built a boat with apologies I've got
I'd have a sorry looking raft
It always rains
But it's nice to see
That someone else is sad
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
The coin's faced up
But I'm not feeling any better
A soap box made for every single fuck up
It's tough seeing where I am
Instead of where I'm from
My roots can get loose
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
Can you find your calling if nothing is calling for you?
I'm coughing up a lung trying to get rid of you
To get rid of you
To get rid of you
Can you find your calling
If nothing's calling for you?
For you?
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
When I heard my parents cry
I realized that we're all lost kids
Trying to find our way home
Blood is thicker than water
And I still feel like everyone I love forgot how to swim
At least there are pictures of my sister and me
Hanging on the wall in my garage
They always give me peace of mind
They always give me peace of mind
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I'm starting to see that
We're always changing
It's just so weird to think that we're always changing
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
I never spent my youth thinking of half the shit I'd go through
Living in the past never helped me
Last night I drove past the house that I grew up in
And tried to find that happiness
Living in the past never helped me
Or anyone move forward
There's no love, no growth for me here
Anymore, anymore
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I know this place is the same and that I'm changing
And I'm just
When I get stopped by a train on my drive home
I don't let it get to me like the rest of the world
I smile and think about how much I've grown over this year
It gives me time to open my mind and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that train
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine without you
I've laid to rest the shit that was always out of my hands
I finally sent all my skeletons away
Like everything I couldn't fix and people I couldn't change
Konstantine always tore me apart and made me cry
Now I hear that song and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that...
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine
Happiness, won't get me over this
Happiness, won't get me over anything, over anything 
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I spend my nights thinking the worst
And telling myself that everything's going to work out
I keep kicking myself in the mouth
Opening up every cut that should be a scar by now
I need the hope I always tell my friends about
I need the hope I always tell my friends about
I sleep with the TV on, it covers up my feelings about the past
Here I am lying awake thinking about how things used to be
I'm sick and tired
I'm sick and tired of being at the same old place in my head
Give me peace of mind
I always backtrack to my old self
When I'm holding on to despair and cracks in my life
I'm holding on when I need to let go
I sleep with the TV on, it covers up my feelings about the past
Here I am lying awake thinking about how things used to be
Doubt is the soil that fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
Doubt is the soil that fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
Doubt is the story of how fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
I'm dirty from head to toe
I'm dirty from head to toe
Change holds me down to the places I don't want to be
When I wake up I look in the mirror and I see
The person that's been scaring me away from moving on
And getting out of my head
I end my nights in the same spot that I told myself I would leave
I want to come home and have it be like it was before I left
I'm starting to see that I keep living alone in the past
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
I can't shake it off
Always a fight between my past,
My head, and my heart, you can cut me up
And spread me all over Illinois
I can't, I can't find myself
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
I'm stuck and I feel like I'm the only one
I end my nights in the same spot that I told myself I would leave
I want to come home and have it be like it was before I left
I'm starting to see that I keep living alone in the past
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
Did I get left behind?
Or is everybody else just hiding that they're lost
Loneliness will never leave my mind
Loneliness will never leave my mind
Did I get left behind?
Or is everybody else just hiding that they're lost
Just when I think I need someone, 
They wrap their arms around my old bones 
And I start breaking apart
I walk away from anyone that cares about me
But I swear my skin's not as rough as I make it out to be
The saddest part is I've been distant since I was sixteen
It keeps me up in bed
I'm stuck here with all the choices I've made 
And the chances I was too afraid to take
I've called myself young and stupid, 
But lately I feel old and desperate
I find it kind of weird how you find yourself 
When you have no one
I look for the right things in all the wrong places
The saddest part is I've been distant since I was sixteen
It keeps me up in bed
I'm stuck here with all the choices I've made 
And the chances I was too afraid to take
I found myself in a late night drives
Without a destination
All I had were thoughts about the past
And a list of my favorite songs to keep me company
But I still struggle and lose myself everyday
I always find myself lost in every line of all these songs
But I felt better when I saw that this is life
And in life were gonna cry
In life were gonna lose sleep
Were gonna feel helpless
But thats how its got to be 
When you lose yourself you'll find what you're looking for
I'm growing past who I used to be
As the night goes on 
I go from feeling out of place to feeling like a ghost
You miss me when I'm gone
But when I'm around it's like I'm hidden behind the paint on the walls
The loneliness will keep me warm tonight
It'll keep me warm seeing as you won't
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more than this
If the open road is my home I'm never leaving
All of the small towns make me throw away my biggest fears
And the big cities make the fucked up stuff feel smaller
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more than this
When I'm not here does anyone miss my secondhand smoke?
Do you wonder where I am or who I'm with?
Call me a mid-twenty sob story
I can't change the way I feel
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more,
Looking for something more
You were easy on my eyes
You were heavy on my heart
I never thought I'd live to see today
You're still in my mind
But not in my chest
I'm a little worn out since you fucking tore me down
You made me believe we had something
I guess that I was wrong
I thought I would be numb to this by now
I guess I was wrong
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
Stick with me or don't stick around at all
I was the boy who was too scared and ran away
I was the glue that never dried
You were the girl that made up her mind
And left me all alone to die
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
I'll sit on my basement floor
Turn off all the lights and try to not think about you
Just know that when I'm down there
I'll know that I won't be running through your mind
You were easy on my eyes
You were heavy on my heart
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
And I'll get through the winter without you
You made me believe we had something
Well I guess that I was wrong
I'm treated like an old book
That was left on the shelf
Everyone underlined what they wanted to read
And forgot the rest
My spine was left worn out and bent
So just take what you want from me
And forget the rest
It really weirds me out 
Because I never thought I'd be where I am today
My bones want to tear out of my skin
This isn't where I want to be
Getting older scares the shit out of me
I'm an old book
It's one of those nights where I'm scared to walk to my basement
These four walls, feel like they're caving in
There's pictures of you and me hidden behind my couch
I'll be waiting for the sun to shine through my window well
Am I trying to forget you or just cover you up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
I used to have an escape
But I ripped the map up a long time ago
So I'll lie to myself and say that I don't care at all
You'll always be hidden in the basement of everything I love
Am I trying to forget you or just cover you up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
The only time that I feel fine
Is when I'm parked in front of my house with tears in my eyes
I find comfort in weakness because it's always there for me
You'll always be hidden in the basement
Of everything I love
Are you trying to forget me or did you cover me up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
I can't believe you've got the nerve to say you love me
Then you left me for dead
I don't love you anymore
I hope you're happy since I don't know you anymore
You were a part of me 
And now you're just nothing but a memory
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
Now I'm just like the pictures that you take
I'm nothing but something that once was
Like colors that fade away in the sunlight
They're nothing special like they used to be
They're gone and they're never coming back
No, they're never coming back
I'm gone and I'm never coming back
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
I woke up today and realized that what we had is dead
I'm just a pile of lifeless bones to you
I've spent too many years thinking about somebody 
That doesn't even think about me
Thinking about somebody that doesn't even think about me
Thinking about somebody That doesn't even think about... 
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
Maybe this place is the same...
And we're just changing
Maybe this place is the same...
And we're just changing
I'm driving on state lines pretending you're standing there
But I know your feet will never be where my eyes fall again
Moving on is something I've always had trouble with
But this year I swear I'll get past it
If I had a backyard I would bury all my memories of you in it
Everything that we had would die right down in the dirt
I wish I had the guts to say this to your face
But the past five years took everything I had and ripped it out of me
You used to make me feel like I was something
Now you make me feel like absolutely nothing
I want to fall asleep and wake up four years ago
We were just kids who didn't know what love was
Or what we were digging ourselves into
I want to know if you ever hear 
All of these sad fucking songs I write about you
I wish I had the guts to say this to your face
But the past five years took everything I had and ripped it out of me
You used to make me feel like I was something
Now you make me feel like absolutely nothing
I know you probably hate who I've become
I'm just young and stupid, 
But that's the way I always want to be
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone 
You wouldn't know a good thing even if it slapped the makeup right off of your face
Burn down the bridges just in time for last call
Keep digging yourself neck deep into selfishness
I doubt that you'll ever find out who you really are
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone
Keep falling over that same fucking step on your front porch
Most people learn from their mistakes
But you'll just stay here tripping on the same mistakes
You always do
No one's knocked you off your feet, they say what you want to hear
You're living proof that we don't always get what we deserve
But you're really nothing special
Just another crack in the sidewalk
You never meant anything to me
Or anyone for more than one night
No one's gonna stick around for when you're broken down and blacked out
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone
Keep falling over that same fucking step on your front porch
Most people learn from their mistakes
But you'll just stay here tripping on the same mistakes
You always do
Throw away your early twenties giving up on everyone and everything around you
It never came so easy
Throw away your early twenties giving up on everyone and everything around you
It never came so easy
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone
Keep falling over that same fucking step on your front porch
Most people learn from their mistakes
But you'll just stay here tripping on the same mistakes
You always do
You used to make me feel like I could walk on water
Now most nights I'm just sinking down and down
You're the reason why I can't listen to the same songs I used to
I write songs about you all the time
I bet I don't run through your mind
I've given up on you, but it still hurts to know you're not alone
Don't worry, I'll keep out of your life and stay awake at night
It's 4am and you're keeping me from closing these sleepy eyes
Does the thought of me keep you up at night?
Like the light on the ceiling of your bedroom
Lately, my dog's the only one around that listens to my problems
It's been a lonely year 
I write songs about you all the time
I bet I don't run through your mind
I've given up on you, but it still hurts to know you're not alone
Don't worry, I'll keep out of your life and stay awake at night
With just my skin and bones
It hurts to know you're not alone
I've given up on you, and my skin, and my bones
Spit in my face, tell me I didn't mean what I said
I'll take those words with me when I'm dead
Open your mouth and contradict everything you said last summer
I don't even know you anymore, anymore
You really fucked me up this time for good, even though you didn't mean to
When the weather clears, that sweatshirt weather won't keep you warm like I do
You'll be thinking of my sleepy eyes and bony knees
You'll be thinking of me
Maybe I'll run away from home, fake my own death and see if you really care
A week goes by, I doubt you'll be waiting around for me at all
No matter how many times I walk up my driveway, you won't be there
You're nowhere to be found because everything you said was a lie
You really fucked me up this time for good, even though you didn't mean to
When the weather clears, that sweatshirt weather won't keep you warm like I do
You'll be thinking of my sleepy eyes and bony knees
You'll be thinking of me
You wanted me when I was running away
I needed you when I ripped your heart out
I can't count the times we fell apart
We can't go back, it's not the same
You really fucked me up this time for good, even though you didn't mean to
When the weather clears, that sweatshirt weather won't keep you warm like I do
You'll be thinking of my sleepy eyes and bony knees
You'll be thinking of me
When something's fallen apart as many times as us
I can't put it back together, it's not the same
This time around I wasn't honest enough with how I really felt
I'll spend the winter blending into the streets and sidewalks that make up this town
At least it gave me someone else to write another one of these sad fucking songs about
You're just another sad song to me
I've got this lonely night and Jimmy Eat World
I never had you and you told me I never did
The truth is you won't even be there when I can't stand on my own two feet
You won't be here
I saw right through you on my basement floor
But could you even see past my chest?
Could you ever feel past these hands?
Your intentions were only skin deep
Mine weren't honest enough to fall past my teeth
I've got this lonely night and Jimmy Eat World
I never had you and you told me I never did
The truth is you won't even be there when I can't stand on my own two feet
You won't be here
Will I ever know how it feels to be home again?
I've been told that home is where the heart is
If that's the case, I've never been home 
I've got this lonely night and Jimmy Eat World
I never had you and you told me I never did
The truth is you won't even be there when I can't stand on my own two feet
You won't be here
I've been up spending every late night in my car listening to all these sad songs
I know it sounds weird but they're helping me move past all these things running through my head
I'll blame the Midwest and sleepy eyes
I'm not where I should be
I'm not what I could be
But I'm not who I was
Nostalgia gets the best of me
When I wake up it's the same day
It fucks me up and makes me miss who I used to be
All I have are thoughts of me from back when I was eighteen and my bony knees
Don't want it to be like my teenage years
I was naive and weak back then without much trouble on my shoulders
If I don't break, I won't know how to put myself back together
Nostalgia gets the best of me
When I wake up it's the same day
It fucks me up and makes me miss who I used to be
All I have are thoughts of me from back when I was eighteen and my bony knees
If you never break, you'll never know how 
If you never break, you'll never know 
If you never break, you'll never know how to put yourself back together
Nostalgia gets the best of me
When I wake up it's the same day
It fucks me up and makes me miss who I used to be
All I have are thoughts of me from back when I was eighteen and my bony knees
Growing up is giving up
I'll sleep sideways on the bed in my moms basement 
It's where I feel at home
You'll sleep with regret and no heart left in your chest
I don't want to end up like you
Your eyes are set on what you'll never have
There's days I feel like a different person 
But I always come back to who I really am 
The American dream is dead, I'm still just a kid
Balancing on the sidewalks of this suburban town
Maybe this year I'll be able to stand up on my feet
Or maybe I'll fall again
I never want to grow out of this skin
That's been dragged through the dirt 
That's what made me find happiness 
My thumbs are broken but I'll take these broken thumbs 
Over your grip on an empty life
Your empty life
I've spent the end of my summer
Listening to these songs I know you don't like
I've been wondering where you are and who you're with
We used to lay on your kitchen floor at two a.m.
I was forty miles away from my house but I never felt so at home
I was forty miles away from my house 
You never called before you left to move west
I was just dead weight pulling you down
I'll move forward without the person I need
When somethings fallen apart as many times as us
I can't put it back together it's not the same
You still run through my head every night
When I lay in bed
You used to cover up the cigarette burn on the passenger seat
of my car
Now there's just empty coffee cups 
And long drives by myself
If you wore your personality on your skin, no one would take a second look
You were shallow when we met and you still are
The water won't be coming down anytime soon to change that
Loneliness keeps me warm at night and that's okay with me
I'd rather be alone in this bed made for two than listen to you and your judgement
Don't act like you're better than me
We're both fools lost in this cold world
You might not fall as much as I do, but if I look close enough I can find the scars on your knees
I can find the bags under your eyes that carry too much for you to handle
I'm starting to think that you're the reason why everyone left
So stop pointing your finger
You don't even really know me, not at all
You don't even really know me
Don't act like you're better than me
We're both fools lost in this cold world
You might not fall as much as I do, but if I look close enough I can find the scars on your knees
I can find the bags under your eyes that carry too much for you to handle
I said I'm selfish, I'm a liar and I'm broken
Shit runs through my head every day that I would never tell anyone
You're just like me
The only difference is that I'm honest enough to scream my flaws in the lines of this song
So much has changed back home since you left without packing all your things 
I always drive past your house hoping you'll be sitting on your porch
I still smell the smoke on your clothes 
And I can still hear those secondhand stories fall off your tongue
It's just not the same around here without you 
Most of the time I feel like you're in over your head out there 
You ran away from the Midwest and traded it in for beaches and east coast sunsets 
Don't take in too much too soon 
Keep your chin up out there 
Don't forget where you came from and who cares about you 
Whenever you're missing home, just look at your arm 
You've got the state lines inked into your forearm 
There's still memories of you pinned on my wall 
It's just not the same around here without you 
Most of the time I feel like you're in over your head out there 
You ran away from the Midwest and traded it in for beaches and east coast sunsets 
Don't take in too much too soon 
Maybe you'll be here next year to waste the fall away, watching the leaves blow across my driveway 
We could listen to American Football and talk about high school 
Just like we did the years before
 

I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure

But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm

I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want
Knock me down
I'm not sure I have it in me to get back up
To be who I am seems exhausting anyway
You have a lot in common with my conscience
You both erase my confidence
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Back and forth
Between some kind of vague attachment to yesterday
And never knowing what form of myself I'll get today (to get today)
I'll always be a faded sign in your eyes
No matter what the point of view (point of view)
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
I'm not here
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want to hear
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Would you notice I'm not here
Am I telling myself the truth?
I'm used to pretending to be strong and clueless
Am I doing this right by you?
I seem to be coming off as wrong and ruthless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I changing my mind again?
All this indecision makes me shift my focus
Is the tension my only friend?
Anxiety holds my hand when life gets hopeless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I telling myself the truth about my self-esteem
And how others place their worth in me?
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
(The eyes of someone else)
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
Yeah, I'll keep smiling on the surface
(Am I telling myself the truth?)
"Smiling On The Surface" is the 3rd song released from the album "Composure". It was premiered on June 18, 2018.
Swallowing a feeling
Counting cracks across the ceiling
Never reached the depths of them before
Finding flaws in every format
I know but haven't shown that
I could pick myself up off the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Redefine rock bottom with these empty orange bottles
Never felt so paralysed before (never felt this paralysed)
We're all looking for some answers
With the hangman's broken lantern
Growing ever closer to the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Why do I, why do I, feel so damn cold?
Why am I, why am I, still so low?
Why should I, why should I, get up or get out?
Why should I?
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
Soft spoken, if ever out loud
These days not much gets out
My mind digs graves through the past
But never takes time to finish the act
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
No matter how cold it might get
My bed sheets are laced with regret
I try to fill in the lines
Rework the plans for a better design
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Here I am, bearing every burden
Here I am, showing every worry
To the world
To the world
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try
I'm at best your second option
Like a key under the mat
Are my emotions hard to read?
Seems I'm good at hiding
Reality
You disregard the consequences
Always seem to shift the blame
You burn the bridge and then I build it
Seems you're good at hiding
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
You make me feel helpless
Like a bird with broken wings
Forcing me to be more selfless
Lean on me, don't knock me over
It seems we're good at hiding
It seems we're good at fighting
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
I'm all alone
I feel sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
I'm all alone
I'm feeling sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
(There's nothing I can do)
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
Is there any chance you could cut me some slack?
Because I've been hanging for a while
From this withered rope
Forcing every sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
What could I ask that you help me hold back
Cause I've been falling for a while
Down this fucking slope
Losing any sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
There's a collage of photos framed
Dating '93 to '95
Though all it shows me is that
I'm just a bad seed
Falling off the family tree
I've got more complaints
More than pleasantries to say
Every monument is idly arranged
Every figure that has ever held importance in my life
I find nobody is who I pictured them to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the faces in reflections of the past
I feel so close but I can't reach through the glass
My life burns out and flickers like the end of a cigarette
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the light in your eyes
Turn the blind eye (Turn the blind eye)
"Why are you hurting me" she screamed from her death bed
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
It's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
The tears run down your cheekbones
I feel sorry for you
But I'm too fucking selfish to say I do
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be different
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Today I ripped myself wide open
And I saw that my heart isn't as fucked as I recalled
It's still flawed and
It's sorely stitched to my old ways
I thought it was buried, but it's just stuck
To my old ways
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be something else
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Shaking in the driver's seat
Staring at the dashboard
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
Please just stay
Please just stay
You see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
To take a chance on me
To take a chance
I still see us sitting on that old couch
'Til the sun comes up
Listening to sad songs
We spent our time with smiles on our faces
I know it sounds selfish but I'll miss those days
I know it sounds selfish
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
The Fall leaves flying through the driveway
Keep triggering these memories of you
I'm torn apart with how our lives are changing
I'm sure it sounds selfish, I'm just being honest
I know it sounds selfish
But I'm trying to be honest
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
Let's go back to when thing weren't complicated
Let's go back to all those old dashboard songs
Let's go back to smoking on the side of my old house
We can never go back, we'll never go back
We'll never go back
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
I know it sounds selfish
I'm just being honest
I can't fix everything around me
I can't make everybody happy
And it'll be okay
Show me how to be something other than nostalgic
I want to feel inspired and innocent again
I just want to be worth your time
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Lately when I'm alone I keep thinking about the past
I'm trying to feel weak in my knees again
I want to stand up straight like when I graduated
I just want to be
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Do you remember when you saw right through my selfish skin?
Do you remember when I ignored everything you did?
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
It'll be okay
We rush through our lives
Just to feel some kind of pride
Dismissing actualities is making matters worse
The ink will fade, but won't go away
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
I live in the middle of a lake
And I don't know how to swim
I've isolated everything
Everywhere I go I am consistently alone
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
Cautions only ever made me worry
You know that cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
The patience I once had is running away with my youth
Away in its hands
I've been neglecting who I am
That's just who I was back then
Don't need to be perfect, just happy
I'm still a lost boy
I'm still a lost boy
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
Every once in a while I listen to Death Cab and think about how it used to be 
We thought that we knew the answers
When no one was asking
Asking the questions 
I'm still a lost boy 
I'm still a lost boy 
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
It feels like I've been taking the long way for a while now
Haven't been at home in more years than I care to say
I keep letting my past cover what the present shouldn't be
What I shouldn't be
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
Staring out the window in my bedroom makes me think back
I see me as a boy out there
Lying in the grass
Singing songs with all the wrong notes
And graduating high school as my mom cries
I'm writing the same song over and over again
And feeling lost
I've always felt so lost
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I clenched the wheel the whole way home from Cleveland
With nothing more than my eyes half way open
And my hand smelling like smoke
Each mile I drive gets me closer to the streets that made me feel alone
I'm out of place and it doesn't feel wrong
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I care too much
While you don't even care at all
It's just sad that you don't even care
I walk up the stairs to your apartment and I feel small
The lowest feelings and even lower standards
Pictures of simple times are on the top shelf
You lie to me and say you're happy with the way things are
With the way things are
It's just sad, oh it's sad that you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I spent so much damn time trying to move forward
It hurts me to watch you falling backwards
Brave your life
Finding solutions, not making excuses
Find solutions and stop waiting for excuses
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I care too much, while you don't even care at all
A bit much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different
Don't settle because you're scared
You know I pictured things to be different
I pictured things to be different for you
For you
Could you stay here 'til I fall asleep?
We'll pretend that we could make each other feel complete
I'm looking for something that's not inside of you
Will you think of me when you drive home?
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
Last night I closed my eyes
And thought about someone that wasn't you
The weight of the world slipped off my shoulders
And weighed my back to the floor
It isn't where you want to be
I know this isn't where you want to be
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
You tell me I'm broken
As I stare out my window at the street lights
I walk outside and I sit in the shade at 3am
And I feel whole again
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
And I know we're disconnected
I'm getting pretty good at leaving, my patience isn't wearing thin
Autumn never ends in my head, no matter how far I've been
It feels like everybody is the branch and I'm the leaves
Falling from the top of every leafless tree
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
All I see is the past two years before I hit the ground
Time is moving slower on the way down (on the way down)
Save your time spent wondering what's going through my mind
Let me go before you see me following behind
I'll save you from myself
Just let me go
I'll save you from myself
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
I've learned that it's okay to be selfish
It keeps me from falling apart at the seams
Stuck is where I feel in place
A feeling I'll embrace
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
So much for bad luck
If I built a boat with apologies I've got
I'd have a sorry looking raft
It always rains
But it's nice to see
That someone else is sad
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
The coin's faced up
But I'm not feeling any better
A soap box made for every single fuck up
It's tough seeing where I am
Instead of where I'm from
My roots can get loose
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
Can you find your calling if nothing is calling for you?
I'm coughing up a lung trying to get rid of you
To get rid of you
To get rid of you
Can you find your calling
If nothing's calling for you?
For you?
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
When I heard my parents cry
I realized that we're all lost kids
Trying to find our way home
Blood is thicker than water
And I still feel like everyone I love forgot how to swim
At least there are pictures of my sister and me
Hanging on the wall in my garage
They always give me peace of mind
They always give me peace of mind
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I'm starting to see that
We're always changing
It's just so weird to think that we're always changing
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
I never spent my youth thinking of half the shit I'd go through
Living in the past never helped me
Last night I drove past the house that I grew up in
And tried to find that happiness
Living in the past never helped me
Or anyone move forward
There's no love, no growth for me here
Anymore, anymore
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I know this place is the same and that I'm changing
And I'm just
When I get stopped by a train on my drive home
I don't let it get to me like the rest of the world
I smile and think about how much I've grown over this year
It gives me time to open my mind and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that train
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine without you
I've laid to rest the shit that was always out of my hands
I finally sent all my skeletons away
Like everything I couldn't fix and people I couldn't change
Konstantine always tore me apart and made me cry
Now I hear that song and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that...
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine
Happiness, won't get me over this
Happiness, won't get me over anything, over anything 
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I spend my nights thinking the worst
And telling myself that everything's going to work out
I keep kicking myself in the mouth
Opening up every cut that should be a scar by now
I need the hope I always tell my friends about
I need the hope I always tell my friends about
I sleep with the TV on, it covers up my feelings about the past
Here I am lying awake thinking about how things used to be
I'm sick and tired
I'm sick and tired of being at the same old place in my head
Give me peace of mind
I always backtrack to my old self
When I'm holding on to despair and cracks in my life
I'm holding on when I need to let go
I sleep with the TV on, it covers up my feelings about the past
Here I am lying awake thinking about how things used to be
Doubt is the soil that fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
Doubt is the soil that fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
Doubt is the story of how fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
I'm dirty from head to toe
I'm dirty from head to toe
Change holds me down to the places I don't want to be
When I wake up I look in the mirror and I see
The person that's been scaring me away from moving on
And getting out of my head
I end my nights in the same spot that I told myself I would leave
I want to come home and have it be like it was before I left
I'm starting to see that I keep living alone in the past
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
I can't shake it off
Always a fight between my past,
My head, and my heart, you can cut me up
And spread me all over Illinois
I can't, I can't find myself
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
I'm stuck and I feel like I'm the only one
I end my nights in the same spot that I told myself I would leave
I want to come home and have it be like it was before I left
I'm starting to see that I keep living alone in the past
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
Did I get left behind?
Or is everybody else just hiding that they're lost
Loneliness will never leave my mind
Loneliness will never leave my mind
Did I get left behind?
Or is everybody else just hiding that they're lost
Just when I think I need someone, 
They wrap their arms around my old bones 
And I start breaking apart
I walk away from anyone that cares about me
But I swear my skin's not as rough as I make it out to be
The saddest part is I've been distant since I was sixteen
It keeps me up in bed
I'm stuck here with all the choices I've made 
And the chances I was too afraid to take
I've called myself young and stupid, 
But lately I feel old and desperate
I find it kind of weird how you find yourself 
When you have no one
I look for the right things in all the wrong places
The saddest part is I've been distant since I was sixteen
It keeps me up in bed
I'm stuck here with all the choices I've made 
And the chances I was too afraid to take
I found myself in a late night drives
Without a destination
All I had were thoughts about the past
And a list of my favorite songs to keep me company
But I still struggle and lose myself everyday
I always find myself lost in every line of all these songs
But I felt better when I saw that this is life
And in life were gonna cry
In life were gonna lose sleep
Were gonna feel helpless
But thats how its got to be 
When you lose yourself you'll find what you're looking for
I'm growing past who I used to be
As the night goes on 
I go from feeling out of place to feeling like a ghost
You miss me when I'm gone
But when I'm around it's like I'm hidden behind the paint on the walls
The loneliness will keep me warm tonight
It'll keep me warm seeing as you won't
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more than this
If the open road is my home I'm never leaving
All of the small towns make me throw away my biggest fears
And the big cities make the fucked up stuff feel smaller
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more than this
When I'm not here does anyone miss my secondhand smoke?
Do you wonder where I am or who I'm with?
Call me a mid-twenty sob story
I can't change the way I feel
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more,
Looking for something more
You were easy on my eyes
You were heavy on my heart
I never thought I'd live to see today
You're still in my mind
But not in my chest
I'm a little worn out since you fucking tore me down
You made me believe we had something
I guess that I was wrong
I thought I would be numb to this by now
I guess I was wrong
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
Stick with me or don't stick around at all
I was the boy who was too scared and ran away
I was the glue that never dried
You were the girl that made up her mind
And left me all alone to die
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
I'll sit on my basement floor
Turn off all the lights and try to not think about you
Just know that when I'm down there
I'll know that I won't be running through your mind
You were easy on my eyes
You were heavy on my heart
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
And I'll get through the winter without you
You made me believe we had something
Well I guess that I was wrong
I'm treated like an old book
That was left on the shelf
Everyone underlined what they wanted to read
And forgot the rest
My spine was left worn out and bent
So just take what you want from me
And forget the rest
It really weirds me out 
Because I never thought I'd be where I am today
My bones want to tear out of my skin
This isn't where I want to be
Getting older scares the shit out of me
I'm an old book
It's one of those nights where I'm scared to walk to my basement
These four walls, feel like they're caving in
There's pictures of you and me hidden behind my couch
I'll be waiting for the sun to shine through my window well
Am I trying to forget you or just cover you up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
I used to have an escape
But I ripped the map up a long time ago
So I'll lie to myself and say that I don't care at all
You'll always be hidden in the basement of everything I love
Am I trying to forget you or just cover you up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
The only time that I feel fine
Is when I'm parked in front of my house with tears in my eyes
I find comfort in weakness because it's always there for me
You'll always be hidden in the basement
Of everything I love
Are you trying to forget me or did you cover me up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
I can't believe you've got the nerve to say you love me
Then you left me for dead
I don't love you anymore
I hope you're happy since I don't know you anymore
You were a part of me 
And now you're just nothing but a memory
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
Now I'm just like the pictures that you take
I'm nothing but something that once was
Like colors that fade away in the sunlight
They're nothing special like they used to be
They're gone and they're never coming back
No, they're never coming back
I'm gone and I'm never coming back
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
I woke up today and realized that what we had is dead
I'm just a pile of lifeless bones to you
I've spent too many years thinking about somebody 
That doesn't even think about me
Thinking about somebody that doesn't even think about me
Thinking about somebody That doesn't even think about... 
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
Maybe this place is the same...
And we're just changing
Maybe this place is the same...
And we're just changing
I'm driving on state lines pretending you're standing there
But I know your feet will never be where my eyes fall again
Moving on is something I've always had trouble with
But this year I swear I'll get past it
If I had a backyard I would bury all my memories of you in it
Everything that we had would die right down in the dirt
I wish I had the guts to say this to your face
But the past five years took everything I had and ripped it out of me
You used to make me feel like I was something
Now you make me feel like absolutely nothing
I want to fall asleep and wake up four years ago
We were just kids who didn't know what love was
Or what we were digging ourselves into
I want to know if you ever hear 
All of these sad fucking songs I write about you
I wish I had the guts to say this to your face
But the past five years took everything I had and ripped it out of me
You used to make me feel like I was something
Now you make me feel like absolutely nothing
I know you probably hate who I've become
I'm just young and stupid, 
But that's the way I always want to be
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone 
You wouldn't know a good thing even if it slapped the makeup right off of your face
Burn down the bridges just in time for last call
Keep digging yourself neck deep into selfishness
I doubt that you'll ever find out who you really are
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone
Keep falling over that same fucking step on your front porch
Most people learn from their mistakes
But you'll just stay here tripping on the same mistakes
You always do
No one's knocked you off your feet, they say what you want to hear
You're living proof that we don't always get what we deserve
But you're really nothing special
Just another crack in the sidewalk
You never meant anything to me
Or anyone for more than one night
No one's gonna stick around for when you're broken down and blacked out
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone
Keep falling over that same fucking step on your front porch
Most people learn from their mistakes
But you'll just stay here tripping on the same mistakes
You always do
Throw away your early twenties giving up on everyone and everything around you
It never came so easy
Throw away your early twenties giving up on everyone and everything around you
It never came so easy
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone
Keep falling over that same fucking step on your front porch
Most people learn from their mistakes
But you'll just stay here tripping on the same mistakes
You always do
You used to make me feel like I could walk on water
Now most nights I'm just sinking down and down
You're the reason why I can't listen to the same songs I used to
I write songs about you all the time
I bet I don't run through your mind
I've given up on you, but it still hurts to know you're not alone
Don't worry, I'll keep out of your life and stay awake at night
It's 4am and you're keeping me from closing these sleepy eyes
Does the thought of me keep you up at night?
Like the light on the ceiling of your bedroom
Lately, my dog's the only one around that listens to my problems
It's been a lonely year 
I write songs about you all the time
I bet I don't run through your mind
I've given up on you, but it still hurts to know you're not alone
Don't worry, I'll keep out of your life and stay awake at night
With just my skin and bones
It hurts to know you're not alone
I've given up on you, and my skin, and my bones
Spit in my face, tell me I didn't mean what I said
I'll take those words with me when I'm dead
Open your mouth and contradict everything you said last summer
I don't even know you anymore, anymore
You really fucked me up this time for good, even though you didn't mean to
When the weather clears, that sweatshirt weather won't keep you warm like I do
You'll be thinking of my sleepy eyes and bony knees
You'll be thinking of me
Maybe I'll run away from home, fake my own death and see if you really care
A week goes by, I doubt you'll be waiting around for me at all
No matter how many times I walk up my driveway, you won't be there
You're nowhere to be found because everything you said was a lie
You really fucked me up this time for good, even though you didn't mean to
When the weather clears, that sweatshirt weather won't keep you warm like I do
You'll be thinking of my sleepy eyes and bony knees
You'll be thinking of me
You wanted me when I was running away
I needed you when I ripped your heart out
I can't count the times we fell apart
We can't go back, it's not the same
You really fucked me up this time for good, even though you didn't mean to
When the weather clears, that sweatshirt weather won't keep you warm like I do
You'll be thinking of my sleepy eyes and bony knees
You'll be thinking of me
When something's fallen apart as many times as us
I can't put it back together, it's not the same
This time around I wasn't honest enough with how I really felt
I'll spend the winter blending into the streets and sidewalks that make up this town
At least it gave me someone else to write another one of these sad fucking songs about
You're just another sad song to me
I've got this lonely night and Jimmy Eat World
I never had you and you told me I never did
The truth is you won't even be there when I can't stand on my own two feet
You won't be here
I saw right through you on my basement floor
But could you even see past my chest?
Could you ever feel past these hands?
Your intentions were only skin deep
Mine weren't honest enough to fall past my teeth
I've got this lonely night and Jimmy Eat World
I never had you and you told me I never did
The truth is you won't even be there when I can't stand on my own two feet
You won't be here
Will I ever know how it feels to be home again?
I've been told that home is where the heart is
If that's the case, I've never been home 
I've got this lonely night and Jimmy Eat World
I never had you and you told me I never did
The truth is you won't even be there when I can't stand on my own two feet
You won't be here
I've been up spending every late night in my car listening to all these sad songs
I know it sounds weird but they're helping me move past all these things running through my head
I'll blame the Midwest and sleepy eyes
I'm not where I should be
I'm not what I could be
But I'm not who I was
Nostalgia gets the best of me
When I wake up it's the same day
It fucks me up and makes me miss who I used to be
All I have are thoughts of me from back when I was eighteen and my bony knees
Don't want it to be like my teenage years
I was naive and weak back then without much trouble on my shoulders
If I don't break, I won't know how to put myself back together
Nostalgia gets the best of me
When I wake up it's the same day
It fucks me up and makes me miss who I used to be
All I have are thoughts of me from back when I was eighteen and my bony knees
If you never break, you'll never know how 
If you never break, you'll never know 
If you never break, you'll never know how to put yourself back together
Nostalgia gets the best of me
When I wake up it's the same day
It fucks me up and makes me miss who I used to be
All I have are thoughts of me from back when I was eighteen and my bony knees
Growing up is giving up
I'll sleep sideways on the bed in my moms basement 
It's where I feel at home
You'll sleep with regret and no heart left in your chest
I don't want to end up like you
Your eyes are set on what you'll never have
There's days I feel like a different person 
But I always come back to who I really am 
The American dream is dead, I'm still just a kid
Balancing on the sidewalks of this suburban town
Maybe this year I'll be able to stand up on my feet
Or maybe I'll fall again
I never want to grow out of this skin
That's been dragged through the dirt 
That's what made me find happiness 
My thumbs are broken but I'll take these broken thumbs 
Over your grip on an empty life
Your empty life
I've spent the end of my summer
Listening to these songs I know you don't like
I've been wondering where you are and who you're with
We used to lay on your kitchen floor at two a.m.
I was forty miles away from my house but I never felt so at home
I was forty miles away from my house 
You never called before you left to move west
I was just dead weight pulling you down
I'll move forward without the person I need
When somethings fallen apart as many times as us
I can't put it back together it's not the same
You still run through my head every night
When I lay in bed
You used to cover up the cigarette burn on the passenger seat
of my car
Now there's just empty coffee cups 
And long drives by myself
If you wore your personality on your skin, no one would take a second look
You were shallow when we met and you still are
The water won't be coming down anytime soon to change that
Loneliness keeps me warm at night and that's okay with me
I'd rather be alone in this bed made for two than listen to you and your judgement
Don't act like you're better than me
We're both fools lost in this cold world
You might not fall as much as I do, but if I look close enough I can find the scars on your knees
I can find the bags under your eyes that carry too much for you to handle
I'm starting to think that you're the reason why everyone left
So stop pointing your finger
You don't even really know me, not at all
You don't even really know me
Don't act like you're better than me
We're both fools lost in this cold world
You might not fall as much as I do, but if I look close enough I can find the scars on your knees
I can find the bags under your eyes that carry too much for you to handle
I said I'm selfish, I'm a liar and I'm broken
Shit runs through my head every day that I would never tell anyone
You're just like me
The only difference is that I'm honest enough to scream my flaws in the lines of this song
So much has changed back home since you left without packing all your things 
I always drive past your house hoping you'll be sitting on your porch
I still smell the smoke on your clothes 
And I can still hear those secondhand stories fall off your tongue
It's just not the same around here without you 
Most of the time I feel like you're in over your head out there 
You ran away from the Midwest and traded it in for beaches and east coast sunsets 
Don't take in too much too soon 
Keep your chin up out there 
Don't forget where you came from and who cares about you 
Whenever you're missing home, just look at your arm 
You've got the state lines inked into your forearm 
There's still memories of you pinned on my wall 
It's just not the same around here without you 
Most of the time I feel like you're in over your head out there 
You ran away from the Midwest and traded it in for beaches and east coast sunsets 
Don't take in too much too soon 
Maybe you'll be here next year to waste the fall away, watching the leaves blow across my driveway 
We could listen to American Football and talk about high school 
Just like we did the years before
Hope you're having fun away at college since you went there to run from all your fuck ups 
You're not so good at getting away from all of the karma that lies between your tongue and cheek 
It's gotten to the point that you're the spitting image of everything I never want to be 
I gave you chance after chance and it's obvious you haven't tried at all 
By now it's safe to say that I'll be erasing every trace you left in these lines 
I'm sorry for breaking down when I should've been stitching myself back up 
You left me on the fence with nowhere to jump since you always knew that my balance was as shitty as my judgment 
I had a feeling I'd be lying in the grass left for dead 
Now I'm stuck looking at that fence 
I gave you chance after chance and it's obvious you haven't tried at all 
By now it's safe to say that I'll be erasing every trace you left in these lines 
I'm sorry for breaking down when I should've been stitching myself back up
You've become the spitting image of everything I never want to be 
You're everything I never want to be
 

I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out

But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory

"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want
Knock me down
I'm not sure I have it in me to get back up
To be who I am seems exhausting anyway
You have a lot in common with my conscience
You both erase my confidence
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Back and forth
Between some kind of vague attachment to yesterday
And never knowing what form of myself I'll get today (to get today)
I'll always be a faded sign in your eyes
No matter what the point of view (point of view)
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
I'm not here
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want to hear
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Would you notice I'm not here
Am I telling myself the truth?
I'm used to pretending to be strong and clueless
Am I doing this right by you?
I seem to be coming off as wrong and ruthless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I changing my mind again?
All this indecision makes me shift my focus
Is the tension my only friend?
Anxiety holds my hand when life gets hopeless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I telling myself the truth about my self-esteem
And how others place their worth in me?
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
(The eyes of someone else)
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
Yeah, I'll keep smiling on the surface
(Am I telling myself the truth?)
"Smiling On The Surface" is the 3rd song released from the album "Composure". It was premiered on June 18, 2018.
Swallowing a feeling
Counting cracks across the ceiling
Never reached the depths of them before
Finding flaws in every format
I know but haven't shown that
I could pick myself up off the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Redefine rock bottom with these empty orange bottles
Never felt so paralysed before (never felt this paralysed)
We're all looking for some answers
With the hangman's broken lantern
Growing ever closer to the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Why do I, why do I, feel so damn cold?
Why am I, why am I, still so low?
Why should I, why should I, get up or get out?
Why should I?
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
Soft spoken, if ever out loud
These days not much gets out
My mind digs graves through the past
But never takes time to finish the act
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
No matter how cold it might get
My bed sheets are laced with regret
I try to fill in the lines
Rework the plans for a better design
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Here I am, bearing every burden
Here I am, showing every worry
To the world
To the world
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try
I'm at best your second option
Like a key under the mat
Are my emotions hard to read?
Seems I'm good at hiding
Reality
You disregard the consequences
Always seem to shift the blame
You burn the bridge and then I build it
Seems you're good at hiding
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
You make me feel helpless
Like a bird with broken wings
Forcing me to be more selfless
Lean on me, don't knock me over
It seems we're good at hiding
It seems we're good at fighting
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
I'm all alone
I feel sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
I'm all alone
I'm feeling sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
(There's nothing I can do)
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
Is there any chance you could cut me some slack?
Because I've been hanging for a while
From this withered rope
Forcing every sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
What could I ask that you help me hold back
Cause I've been falling for a while
Down this fucking slope
Losing any sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
There's a collage of photos framed
Dating '93 to '95
Though all it shows me is that
I'm just a bad seed
Falling off the family tree
I've got more complaints
More than pleasantries to say
Every monument is idly arranged
Every figure that has ever held importance in my life
I find nobody is who I pictured them to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the faces in reflections of the past
I feel so close but I can't reach through the glass
My life burns out and flickers like the end of a cigarette
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the light in your eyes
Turn the blind eye (Turn the blind eye)
"Why are you hurting me" she screamed from her death bed
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
It's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
The tears run down your cheekbones
I feel sorry for you
But I'm too fucking selfish to say I do
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be different
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Today I ripped myself wide open
And I saw that my heart isn't as fucked as I recalled
It's still flawed and
It's sorely stitched to my old ways
I thought it was buried, but it's just stuck
To my old ways
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be something else
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Shaking in the driver's seat
Staring at the dashboard
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
Please just stay
Please just stay
You see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
To take a chance on me
To take a chance
I still see us sitting on that old couch
'Til the sun comes up
Listening to sad songs
We spent our time with smiles on our faces
I know it sounds selfish but I'll miss those days
I know it sounds selfish
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
The Fall leaves flying through the driveway
Keep triggering these memories of you
I'm torn apart with how our lives are changing
I'm sure it sounds selfish, I'm just being honest
I know it sounds selfish
But I'm trying to be honest
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
Let's go back to when thing weren't complicated
Let's go back to all those old dashboard songs
Let's go back to smoking on the side of my old house
We can never go back, we'll never go back
We'll never go back
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
I know it sounds selfish
I'm just being honest
I can't fix everything around me
I can't make everybody happy
And it'll be okay
Show me how to be something other than nostalgic
I want to feel inspired and innocent again
I just want to be worth your time
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Lately when I'm alone I keep thinking about the past
I'm trying to feel weak in my knees again
I want to stand up straight like when I graduated
I just want to be
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Do you remember when you saw right through my selfish skin?
Do you remember when I ignored everything you did?
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
It'll be okay
We rush through our lives
Just to feel some kind of pride
Dismissing actualities is making matters worse
The ink will fade, but won't go away
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
I live in the middle of a lake
And I don't know how to swim
I've isolated everything
Everywhere I go I am consistently alone
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
Cautions only ever made me worry
You know that cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
The patience I once had is running away with my youth
Away in its hands
I've been neglecting who I am
That's just who I was back then
Don't need to be perfect, just happy
I'm still a lost boy
I'm still a lost boy
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
Every once in a while I listen to Death Cab and think about how it used to be 
We thought that we knew the answers
When no one was asking
Asking the questions 
I'm still a lost boy 
I'm still a lost boy 
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
It feels like I've been taking the long way for a while now
Haven't been at home in more years than I care to say
I keep letting my past cover what the present shouldn't be
What I shouldn't be
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
Staring out the window in my bedroom makes me think back
I see me as a boy out there
Lying in the grass
Singing songs with all the wrong notes
And graduating high school as my mom cries
I'm writing the same song over and over again
And feeling lost
I've always felt so lost
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I clenched the wheel the whole way home from Cleveland
With nothing more than my eyes half way open
And my hand smelling like smoke
Each mile I drive gets me closer to the streets that made me feel alone
I'm out of place and it doesn't feel wrong
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I care too much
While you don't even care at all
It's just sad that you don't even care
I walk up the stairs to your apartment and I feel small
The lowest feelings and even lower standards
Pictures of simple times are on the top shelf
You lie to me and say you're happy with the way things are
With the way things are
It's just sad, oh it's sad that you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I spent so much damn time trying to move forward
It hurts me to watch you falling backwards
Brave your life
Finding solutions, not making excuses
Find solutions and stop waiting for excuses
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I care too much, while you don't even care at all
A bit much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different
Don't settle because you're scared
You know I pictured things to be different
I pictured things to be different for you
For you
Could you stay here 'til I fall asleep?
We'll pretend that we could make each other feel complete
I'm looking for something that's not inside of you
Will you think of me when you drive home?
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
Last night I closed my eyes
And thought about someone that wasn't you
The weight of the world slipped off my shoulders
And weighed my back to the floor
It isn't where you want to be
I know this isn't where you want to be
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
You tell me I'm broken
As I stare out my window at the street lights
I walk outside and I sit in the shade at 3am
And I feel whole again
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
And I know we're disconnected
I'm getting pretty good at leaving, my patience isn't wearing thin
Autumn never ends in my head, no matter how far I've been
It feels like everybody is the branch and I'm the leaves
Falling from the top of every leafless tree
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
All I see is the past two years before I hit the ground
Time is moving slower on the way down (on the way down)
Save your time spent wondering what's going through my mind
Let me go before you see me following behind
I'll save you from myself
Just let me go
I'll save you from myself
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
I've learned that it's okay to be selfish
It keeps me from falling apart at the seams
Stuck is where I feel in place
A feeling I'll embrace
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
So much for bad luck
If I built a boat with apologies I've got
I'd have a sorry looking raft
It always rains
But it's nice to see
That someone else is sad
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
The coin's faced up
But I'm not feeling any better
A soap box made for every single fuck up
It's tough seeing where I am
Instead of where I'm from
My roots can get loose
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
Can you find your calling if nothing is calling for you?
I'm coughing up a lung trying to get rid of you
To get rid of you
To get rid of you
Can you find your calling
If nothing's calling for you?
For you?
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
When I heard my parents cry
I realized that we're all lost kids
Trying to find our way home
Blood is thicker than water
And I still feel like everyone I love forgot how to swim
At least there are pictures of my sister and me
Hanging on the wall in my garage
They always give me peace of mind
They always give me peace of mind
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I'm starting to see that
We're always changing
It's just so weird to think that we're always changing
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
I never spent my youth thinking of half the shit I'd go through
Living in the past never helped me
Last night I drove past the house that I grew up in
And tried to find that happiness
Living in the past never helped me
Or anyone move forward
There's no love, no growth for me here
Anymore, anymore
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I know this place is the same and that I'm changing
And I'm just
When I get stopped by a train on my drive home
I don't let it get to me like the rest of the world
I smile and think about how much I've grown over this year
It gives me time to open my mind and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that train
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine without you
I've laid to rest the shit that was always out of my hands
I finally sent all my skeletons away
Like everything I couldn't fix and people I couldn't change
Konstantine always tore me apart and made me cry
Now I hear that song and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that...
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine
Happiness, won't get me over this
Happiness, won't get me over anything, over anything 
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I spend my nights thinking the worst
And telling myself that everything's going to work out
I keep kicking myself in the mouth
Opening up every cut that should be a scar by now
I need the hope I always tell my friends about
I need the hope I always tell my friends about
I sleep with the TV on, it covers up my feelings about the past
Here I am lying awake thinking about how things used to be
I'm sick and tired
I'm sick and tired of being at the same old place in my head
Give me peace of mind
I always backtrack to my old self
When I'm holding on to despair and cracks in my life
I'm holding on when I need to let go
I sleep with the TV on, it covers up my feelings about the past
Here I am lying awake thinking about how things used to be
Doubt is the soil that fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
Doubt is the soil that fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
Doubt is the story of how fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
I'm dirty from head to toe
I'm dirty from head to toe
Change holds me down to the places I don't want to be
When I wake up I look in the mirror and I see
The person that's been scaring me away from moving on
And getting out of my head
I end my nights in the same spot that I told myself I would leave
I want to come home and have it be like it was before I left
I'm starting to see that I keep living alone in the past
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
I can't shake it off
Always a fight between my past,
My head, and my heart, you can cut me up
And spread me all over Illinois
I can't, I can't find myself
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
I'm stuck and I feel like I'm the only one
I end my nights in the same spot that I told myself I would leave
I want to come home and have it be like it was before I left
I'm starting to see that I keep living alone in the past
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
Did I get left behind?
Or is everybody else just hiding that they're lost
Loneliness will never leave my mind
Loneliness will never leave my mind
Did I get left behind?
Or is everybody else just hiding that they're lost
Just when I think I need someone, 
They wrap their arms around my old bones 
And I start breaking apart
I walk away from anyone that cares about me
But I swear my skin's not as rough as I make it out to be
The saddest part is I've been distant since I was sixteen
It keeps me up in bed
I'm stuck here with all the choices I've made 
And the chances I was too afraid to take
I've called myself young and stupid, 
But lately I feel old and desperate
I find it kind of weird how you find yourself 
When you have no one
I look for the right things in all the wrong places
The saddest part is I've been distant since I was sixteen
It keeps me up in bed
I'm stuck here with all the choices I've made 
And the chances I was too afraid to take
I found myself in a late night drives
Without a destination
All I had were thoughts about the past
And a list of my favorite songs to keep me company
But I still struggle and lose myself everyday
I always find myself lost in every line of all these songs
But I felt better when I saw that this is life
And in life were gonna cry
In life were gonna lose sleep
Were gonna feel helpless
But thats how its got to be 
When you lose yourself you'll find what you're looking for
I'm growing past who I used to be
As the night goes on 
I go from feeling out of place to feeling like a ghost
You miss me when I'm gone
But when I'm around it's like I'm hidden behind the paint on the walls
The loneliness will keep me warm tonight
It'll keep me warm seeing as you won't
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more than this
If the open road is my home I'm never leaving
All of the small towns make me throw away my biggest fears
And the big cities make the fucked up stuff feel smaller
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more than this
When I'm not here does anyone miss my secondhand smoke?
Do you wonder where I am or who I'm with?
Call me a mid-twenty sob story
I can't change the way I feel
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more,
Looking for something more
You were easy on my eyes
You were heavy on my heart
I never thought I'd live to see today
You're still in my mind
But not in my chest
I'm a little worn out since you fucking tore me down
You made me believe we had something
I guess that I was wrong
I thought I would be numb to this by now
I guess I was wrong
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
Stick with me or don't stick around at all
I was the boy who was too scared and ran away
I was the glue that never dried
You were the girl that made up her mind
And left me all alone to die
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
I'll sit on my basement floor
Turn off all the lights and try to not think about you
Just know that when I'm down there
I'll know that I won't be running through your mind
You were easy on my eyes
You were heavy on my heart
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
And I'll get through the winter without you
You made me believe we had something
Well I guess that I was wrong
I'm treated like an old book
That was left on the shelf
Everyone underlined what they wanted to read
And forgot the rest
My spine was left worn out and bent
So just take what you want from me
And forget the rest
It really weirds me out 
Because I never thought I'd be where I am today
My bones want to tear out of my skin
This isn't where I want to be
Getting older scares the shit out of me
I'm an old book
It's one of those nights where I'm scared to walk to my basement
These four walls, feel like they're caving in
There's pictures of you and me hidden behind my couch
I'll be waiting for the sun to shine through my window well
Am I trying to forget you or just cover you up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
I used to have an escape
But I ripped the map up a long time ago
So I'll lie to myself and say that I don't care at all
You'll always be hidden in the basement of everything I love
Am I trying to forget you or just cover you up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
The only time that I feel fine
Is when I'm parked in front of my house with tears in my eyes
I find comfort in weakness because it's always there for me
You'll always be hidden in the basement
Of everything I love
Are you trying to forget me or did you cover me up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
I can't believe you've got the nerve to say you love me
Then you left me for dead
I don't love you anymore
I hope you're happy since I don't know you anymore
You were a part of me 
And now you're just nothing but a memory
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
Now I'm just like the pictures that you take
I'm nothing but something that once was
Like colors that fade away in the sunlight
They're nothing special like they used to be
They're gone and they're never coming back
No, they're never coming back
I'm gone and I'm never coming back
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
I woke up today and realized that what we had is dead
I'm just a pile of lifeless bones to you
I've spent too many years thinking about somebody 
That doesn't even think about me
Thinking about somebody that doesn't even think about me
Thinking about somebody That doesn't even think about... 
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
Maybe this place is the same...
And we're just changing
Maybe this place is the same...
And we're just changing
I'm driving on state lines pretending you're standing there
But I know your feet will never be where my eyes fall again
Moving on is something I've always had trouble with
But this year I swear I'll get past it
If I had a backyard I would bury all my memories of you in it
Everything that we had would die right down in the dirt
I wish I had the guts to say this to your face
But the past five years took everything I had and ripped it out of me
You used to make me feel like I was something
Now you make me feel like absolutely nothing
I want to fall asleep and wake up four years ago
We were just kids who didn't know what love was
Or what we were digging ourselves into
I want to know if you ever hear 
All of these sad fucking songs I write about you
I wish I had the guts to say this to your face
But the past five years took everything I had and ripped it out of me
You used to make me feel like I was something
Now you make me feel like absolutely nothing
I know you probably hate who I've become
I'm just young and stupid, 
But that's the way I always want to be
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone 
You wouldn't know a good thing even if it slapped the makeup right off of your face
Burn down the bridges just in time for last call
Keep digging yourself neck deep into selfishness
I doubt that you'll ever find out who you really are
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone
Keep falling over that same fucking step on your front porch
Most people learn from their mistakes
But you'll just stay here tripping on the same mistakes
You always do
No one's knocked you off your feet, they say what you want to hear
You're living proof that we don't always get what we deserve
But you're really nothing special
Just another crack in the sidewalk
You never meant anything to me
Or anyone for more than one night
No one's gonna stick around for when you're broken down and blacked out
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone
Keep falling over that same fucking step on your front porch
Most people learn from their mistakes
But you'll just stay here tripping on the same mistakes
You always do
Throw away your early twenties giving up on everyone and everything around you
It never came so easy
Throw away your early twenties giving up on everyone and everything around you
It never came so easy
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone
Keep falling over that same fucking step on your front porch
Most people learn from their mistakes
But you'll just stay here tripping on the same mistakes
You always do
You used to make me feel like I could walk on water
Now most nights I'm just sinking down and down
You're the reason why I can't listen to the same songs I used to
I write songs about you all the time
I bet I don't run through your mind
I've given up on you, but it still hurts to know you're not alone
Don't worry, I'll keep out of your life and stay awake at night
It's 4am and you're keeping me from closing these sleepy eyes
Does the thought of me keep you up at night?
Like the light on the ceiling of your bedroom
Lately, my dog's the only one around that listens to my problems
It's been a lonely year 
I write songs about you all the time
I bet I don't run through your mind
I've given up on you, but it still hurts to know you're not alone
Don't worry, I'll keep out of your life and stay awake at night
With just my skin and bones
It hurts to know you're not alone
I've given up on you, and my skin, and my bones
Spit in my face, tell me I didn't mean what I said
I'll take those words with me when I'm dead
Open your mouth and contradict everything you said last summer
I don't even know you anymore, anymore
You really fucked me up this time for good, even though you didn't mean to
When the weather clears, that sweatshirt weather won't keep you warm like I do
You'll be thinking of my sleepy eyes and bony knees
You'll be thinking of me
Maybe I'll run away from home, fake my own death and see if you really care
A week goes by, I doubt you'll be waiting around for me at all
No matter how many times I walk up my driveway, you won't be there
You're nowhere to be found because everything you said was a lie
You really fucked me up this time for good, even though you didn't mean to
When the weather clears, that sweatshirt weather won't keep you warm like I do
You'll be thinking of my sleepy eyes and bony knees
You'll be thinking of me
You wanted me when I was running away
I needed you when I ripped your heart out
I can't count the times we fell apart
We can't go back, it's not the same
You really fucked me up this time for good, even though you didn't mean to
When the weather clears, that sweatshirt weather won't keep you warm like I do
You'll be thinking of my sleepy eyes and bony knees
You'll be thinking of me
When something's fallen apart as many times as us
I can't put it back together, it's not the same
This time around I wasn't honest enough with how I really felt
I'll spend the winter blending into the streets and sidewalks that make up this town
At least it gave me someone else to write another one of these sad fucking songs about
You're just another sad song to me
I've got this lonely night and Jimmy Eat World
I never had you and you told me I never did
The truth is you won't even be there when I can't stand on my own two feet
You won't be here
I saw right through you on my basement floor
But could you even see past my chest?
Could you ever feel past these hands?
Your intentions were only skin deep
Mine weren't honest enough to fall past my teeth
I've got this lonely night and Jimmy Eat World
I never had you and you told me I never did
The truth is you won't even be there when I can't stand on my own two feet
You won't be here
Will I ever know how it feels to be home again?
I've been told that home is where the heart is
If that's the case, I've never been home 
I've got this lonely night and Jimmy Eat World
I never had you and you told me I never did
The truth is you won't even be there when I can't stand on my own two feet
You won't be here
I've been up spending every late night in my car listening to all these sad songs
I know it sounds weird but they're helping me move past all these things running through my head
I'll blame the Midwest and sleepy eyes
I'm not where I should be
I'm not what I could be
But I'm not who I was
Nostalgia gets the best of me
When I wake up it's the same day
It fucks me up and makes me miss who I used to be
All I have are thoughts of me from back when I was eighteen and my bony knees
Don't want it to be like my teenage years
I was naive and weak back then without much trouble on my shoulders
If I don't break, I won't know how to put myself back together
Nostalgia gets the best of me
When I wake up it's the same day
It fucks me up and makes me miss who I used to be
All I have are thoughts of me from back when I was eighteen and my bony knees
If you never break, you'll never know how 
If you never break, you'll never know 
If you never break, you'll never know how to put yourself back together
Nostalgia gets the best of me
When I wake up it's the same day
It fucks me up and makes me miss who I used to be
All I have are thoughts of me from back when I was eighteen and my bony knees
Growing up is giving up
I'll sleep sideways on the bed in my moms basement 
It's where I feel at home
You'll sleep with regret and no heart left in your chest
I don't want to end up like you
Your eyes are set on what you'll never have
There's days I feel like a different person 
But I always come back to who I really am 
The American dream is dead, I'm still just a kid
Balancing on the sidewalks of this suburban town
Maybe this year I'll be able to stand up on my feet
Or maybe I'll fall again
I never want to grow out of this skin
That's been dragged through the dirt 
That's what made me find happiness 
My thumbs are broken but I'll take these broken thumbs 
Over your grip on an empty life
Your empty life
I've spent the end of my summer
Listening to these songs I know you don't like
I've been wondering where you are and who you're with
We used to lay on your kitchen floor at two a.m.
I was forty miles away from my house but I never felt so at home
I was forty miles away from my house 
You never called before you left to move west
I was just dead weight pulling you down
I'll move forward without the person I need
When somethings fallen apart as many times as us
I can't put it back together it's not the same
You still run through my head every night
When I lay in bed
You used to cover up the cigarette burn on the passenger seat
of my car
Now there's just empty coffee cups 
And long drives by myself
If you wore your personality on your skin, no one would take a second look
You were shallow when we met and you still are
The water won't be coming down anytime soon to change that
Loneliness keeps me warm at night and that's okay with me
I'd rather be alone in this bed made for two than listen to you and your judgement
Don't act like you're better than me
We're both fools lost in this cold world
You might not fall as much as I do, but if I look close enough I can find the scars on your knees
I can find the bags under your eyes that carry too much for you to handle
I'm starting to think that you're the reason why everyone left
So stop pointing your finger
You don't even really know me, not at all
You don't even really know me
Don't act like you're better than me
We're both fools lost in this cold world
You might not fall as much as I do, but if I look close enough I can find the scars on your knees
I can find the bags under your eyes that carry too much for you to handle
I said I'm selfish, I'm a liar and I'm broken
Shit runs through my head every day that I would never tell anyone
You're just like me
The only difference is that I'm honest enough to scream my flaws in the lines of this song
So much has changed back home since you left without packing all your things 
I always drive past your house hoping you'll be sitting on your porch
I still smell the smoke on your clothes 
And I can still hear those secondhand stories fall off your tongue
It's just not the same around here without you 
Most of the time I feel like you're in over your head out there 
You ran away from the Midwest and traded it in for beaches and east coast sunsets 
Don't take in too much too soon 
Keep your chin up out there 
Don't forget where you came from and who cares about you 
Whenever you're missing home, just look at your arm 
You've got the state lines inked into your forearm 
There's still memories of you pinned on my wall 
It's just not the same around here without you 
Most of the time I feel like you're in over your head out there 
You ran away from the Midwest and traded it in for beaches and east coast sunsets 
Don't take in too much too soon 
Maybe you'll be here next year to waste the fall away, watching the leaves blow across my driveway 
We could listen to American Football and talk about high school 
Just like we did the years before
Hope you're having fun away at college since you went there to run from all your fuck ups 
You're not so good at getting away from all of the karma that lies between your tongue and cheek 
It's gotten to the point that you're the spitting image of everything I never want to be 
I gave you chance after chance and it's obvious you haven't tried at all 
By now it's safe to say that I'll be erasing every trace you left in these lines 
I'm sorry for breaking down when I should've been stitching myself back up 
You left me on the fence with nowhere to jump since you always knew that my balance was as shitty as my judgment 
I had a feeling I'd be lying in the grass left for dead 
Now I'm stuck looking at that fence 
I gave you chance after chance and it's obvious you haven't tried at all 
By now it's safe to say that I'll be erasing every trace you left in these lines 
I'm sorry for breaking down when I should've been stitching myself back up
You've become the spitting image of everything I never want to be 
You're everything I never want to be
You'll spend every Saturday night on the bathroom floor with no recollection of the night before 
You're a train wreck and everything that's in between 
Being alone doesn't seem so bad to me 
You're the type of girl that lets this whole town know when your lips come anywhere near a bottle 
All you want is the attention from every eye and ear that covers up the walls in this room 
I'd rather sleep with just my bony knees and the thought of someone that stands up straight 
I guess I'll sleep alone tonight 
You'll tell everyone you're different, but you're just a shade of grey that never stuck out to anybody 
Fast forward to 2am and the walls aren't spinning around enough for you to forget your ex-boyfriend and all of your shitty friends 
You say you'll keep it together, but I know you're gonna make those walls fall down 
They always do 
I'd rather sleep with just my bony knees and the thought of someone that stands up straight 
I guess I'll sleep alone tonight 
You'll tell everyone you're different, but you're just a shade of grey that never stuck out to anybody 
I'd rather sleep with just my bony knees and the thought of someone that stands up straight 
I guess I'll sleep alone 
I'd rather sleep with just my bony knees and the thought of someone that stands up straight 
I guess I'll sleep alone tonight 
You'll tell everyone you're different, but you're just a shade of grey that never stuck out to anybody
 

I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable

But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm

With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want
Knock me down
I'm not sure I have it in me to get back up
To be who I am seems exhausting anyway
You have a lot in common with my conscience
You both erase my confidence
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Back and forth
Between some kind of vague attachment to yesterday
And never knowing what form of myself I'll get today (to get today)
I'll always be a faded sign in your eyes
No matter what the point of view (point of view)
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
I'm not here
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want to hear
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Would you notice I'm not here
Am I telling myself the truth?
I'm used to pretending to be strong and clueless
Am I doing this right by you?
I seem to be coming off as wrong and ruthless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I changing my mind again?
All this indecision makes me shift my focus
Is the tension my only friend?
Anxiety holds my hand when life gets hopeless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I telling myself the truth about my self-esteem
And how others place their worth in me?
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
(The eyes of someone else)
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
Yeah, I'll keep smiling on the surface
(Am I telling myself the truth?)
"Smiling On The Surface" is the 3rd song released from the album "Composure". It was premiered on June 18, 2018.
Swallowing a feeling
Counting cracks across the ceiling
Never reached the depths of them before
Finding flaws in every format
I know but haven't shown that
I could pick myself up off the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Redefine rock bottom with these empty orange bottles
Never felt so paralysed before (never felt this paralysed)
We're all looking for some answers
With the hangman's broken lantern
Growing ever closer to the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Why do I, why do I, feel so damn cold?
Why am I, why am I, still so low?
Why should I, why should I, get up or get out?
Why should I?
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
Soft spoken, if ever out loud
These days not much gets out
My mind digs graves through the past
But never takes time to finish the act
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
No matter how cold it might get
My bed sheets are laced with regret
I try to fill in the lines
Rework the plans for a better design
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Here I am, bearing every burden
Here I am, showing every worry
To the world
To the world
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try
I'm at best your second option
Like a key under the mat
Are my emotions hard to read?
Seems I'm good at hiding
Reality
You disregard the consequences
Always seem to shift the blame
You burn the bridge and then I build it
Seems you're good at hiding
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
You make me feel helpless
Like a bird with broken wings
Forcing me to be more selfless
Lean on me, don't knock me over
It seems we're good at hiding
It seems we're good at fighting
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
I'm all alone
I feel sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
I'm all alone
I'm feeling sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
(There's nothing I can do)
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
Is there any chance you could cut me some slack?
Because I've been hanging for a while
From this withered rope
Forcing every sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
What could I ask that you help me hold back
Cause I've been falling for a while
Down this fucking slope
Losing any sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
There's a collage of photos framed
Dating '93 to '95
Though all it shows me is that
I'm just a bad seed
Falling off the family tree
I've got more complaints
More than pleasantries to say
Every monument is idly arranged
Every figure that has ever held importance in my life
I find nobody is who I pictured them to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the faces in reflections of the past
I feel so close but I can't reach through the glass
My life burns out and flickers like the end of a cigarette
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the light in your eyes
Turn the blind eye (Turn the blind eye)
"Why are you hurting me" she screamed from her death bed
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
It's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
The tears run down your cheekbones
I feel sorry for you
But I'm too fucking selfish to say I do
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be different
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Today I ripped myself wide open
And I saw that my heart isn't as fucked as I recalled
It's still flawed and
It's sorely stitched to my old ways
I thought it was buried, but it's just stuck
To my old ways
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be something else
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Shaking in the driver's seat
Staring at the dashboard
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
Please just stay
Please just stay
You see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
To take a chance on me
To take a chance
I still see us sitting on that old couch
'Til the sun comes up
Listening to sad songs
We spent our time with smiles on our faces
I know it sounds selfish but I'll miss those days
I know it sounds selfish
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
The Fall leaves flying through the driveway
Keep triggering these memories of you
I'm torn apart with how our lives are changing
I'm sure it sounds selfish, I'm just being honest
I know it sounds selfish
But I'm trying to be honest
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
Let's go back to when thing weren't complicated
Let's go back to all those old dashboard songs
Let's go back to smoking on the side of my old house
We can never go back, we'll never go back
We'll never go back
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
I know it sounds selfish
I'm just being honest
I can't fix everything around me
I can't make everybody happy
And it'll be okay
Show me how to be something other than nostalgic
I want to feel inspired and innocent again
I just want to be worth your time
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Lately when I'm alone I keep thinking about the past
I'm trying to feel weak in my knees again
I want to stand up straight like when I graduated
I just want to be
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Do you remember when you saw right through my selfish skin?
Do you remember when I ignored everything you did?
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
It'll be okay
We rush through our lives
Just to feel some kind of pride
Dismissing actualities is making matters worse
The ink will fade, but won't go away
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
I live in the middle of a lake
And I don't know how to swim
I've isolated everything
Everywhere I go I am consistently alone
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
Cautions only ever made me worry
You know that cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
The patience I once had is running away with my youth
Away in its hands
I've been neglecting who I am
That's just who I was back then
Don't need to be perfect, just happy
I'm still a lost boy
I'm still a lost boy
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
Every once in a while I listen to Death Cab and think about how it used to be 
We thought that we knew the answers
When no one was asking
Asking the questions 
I'm still a lost boy 
I'm still a lost boy 
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
It feels like I've been taking the long way for a while now
Haven't been at home in more years than I care to say
I keep letting my past cover what the present shouldn't be
What I shouldn't be
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
Staring out the window in my bedroom makes me think back
I see me as a boy out there
Lying in the grass
Singing songs with all the wrong notes
And graduating high school as my mom cries
I'm writing the same song over and over again
And feeling lost
I've always felt so lost
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I clenched the wheel the whole way home from Cleveland
With nothing more than my eyes half way open
And my hand smelling like smoke
Each mile I drive gets me closer to the streets that made me feel alone
I'm out of place and it doesn't feel wrong
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I care too much
While you don't even care at all
It's just sad that you don't even care
I walk up the stairs to your apartment and I feel small
The lowest feelings and even lower standards
Pictures of simple times are on the top shelf
You lie to me and say you're happy with the way things are
With the way things are
It's just sad, oh it's sad that you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I spent so much damn time trying to move forward
It hurts me to watch you falling backwards
Brave your life
Finding solutions, not making excuses
Find solutions and stop waiting for excuses
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I care too much, while you don't even care at all
A bit much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different
Don't settle because you're scared
You know I pictured things to be different
I pictured things to be different for you
For you
Could you stay here 'til I fall asleep?
We'll pretend that we could make each other feel complete
I'm looking for something that's not inside of you
Will you think of me when you drive home?
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
Last night I closed my eyes
And thought about someone that wasn't you
The weight of the world slipped off my shoulders
And weighed my back to the floor
It isn't where you want to be
I know this isn't where you want to be
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
You tell me I'm broken
As I stare out my window at the street lights
I walk outside and I sit in the shade at 3am
And I feel whole again
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
And I know we're disconnected
I'm getting pretty good at leaving, my patience isn't wearing thin
Autumn never ends in my head, no matter how far I've been
It feels like everybody is the branch and I'm the leaves
Falling from the top of every leafless tree
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
All I see is the past two years before I hit the ground
Time is moving slower on the way down (on the way down)
Save your time spent wondering what's going through my mind
Let me go before you see me following behind
I'll save you from myself
Just let me go
I'll save you from myself
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
I've learned that it's okay to be selfish
It keeps me from falling apart at the seams
Stuck is where I feel in place
A feeling I'll embrace
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
So much for bad luck
If I built a boat with apologies I've got
I'd have a sorry looking raft
It always rains
But it's nice to see
That someone else is sad
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
The coin's faced up
But I'm not feeling any better
A soap box made for every single fuck up
It's tough seeing where I am
Instead of where I'm from
My roots can get loose
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
Can you find your calling if nothing is calling for you?
I'm coughing up a lung trying to get rid of you
To get rid of you
To get rid of you
Can you find your calling
If nothing's calling for you?
For you?
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
When I heard my parents cry
I realized that we're all lost kids
Trying to find our way home
Blood is thicker than water
And I still feel like everyone I love forgot how to swim
At least there are pictures of my sister and me
Hanging on the wall in my garage
They always give me peace of mind
They always give me peace of mind
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I'm starting to see that
We're always changing
It's just so weird to think that we're always changing
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
I never spent my youth thinking of half the shit I'd go through
Living in the past never helped me
Last night I drove past the house that I grew up in
And tried to find that happiness
Living in the past never helped me
Or anyone move forward
There's no love, no growth for me here
Anymore, anymore
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I know this place is the same and that I'm changing
And I'm just
When I get stopped by a train on my drive home
I don't let it get to me like the rest of the world
I smile and think about how much I've grown over this year
It gives me time to open my mind and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that train
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine without you
I've laid to rest the shit that was always out of my hands
I finally sent all my skeletons away
Like everything I couldn't fix and people I couldn't change
Konstantine always tore me apart and made me cry
Now I hear that song and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that...
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine
Happiness, won't get me over this
Happiness, won't get me over anything, over anything 
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I spend my nights thinking the worst
And telling myself that everything's going to work out
I keep kicking myself in the mouth
Opening up every cut that should be a scar by now
I need the hope I always tell my friends about
I need the hope I always tell my friends about
I sleep with the TV on, it covers up my feelings about the past
Here I am lying awake thinking about how things used to be
I'm sick and tired
I'm sick and tired of being at the same old place in my head
Give me peace of mind
I always backtrack to my old self
When I'm holding on to despair and cracks in my life
I'm holding on when I need to let go
I sleep with the TV on, it covers up my feelings about the past
Here I am lying awake thinking about how things used to be
Doubt is the soil that fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
Doubt is the soil that fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
Doubt is the story of how fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
I'm dirty from head to toe
I'm dirty from head to toe
Change holds me down to the places I don't want to be
When I wake up I look in the mirror and I see
The person that's been scaring me away from moving on
And getting out of my head
I end my nights in the same spot that I told myself I would leave
I want to come home and have it be like it was before I left
I'm starting to see that I keep living alone in the past
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
I can't shake it off
Always a fight between my past,
My head, and my heart, you can cut me up
And spread me all over Illinois
I can't, I can't find myself
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
I'm stuck and I feel like I'm the only one
I end my nights in the same spot that I told myself I would leave
I want to come home and have it be like it was before I left
I'm starting to see that I keep living alone in the past
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
Did I get left behind?
Or is everybody else just hiding that they're lost
Loneliness will never leave my mind
Loneliness will never leave my mind
Did I get left behind?
Or is everybody else just hiding that they're lost
Just when I think I need someone, 
They wrap their arms around my old bones 
And I start breaking apart
I walk away from anyone that cares about me
But I swear my skin's not as rough as I make it out to be
The saddest part is I've been distant since I was sixteen
It keeps me up in bed
I'm stuck here with all the choices I've made 
And the chances I was too afraid to take
I've called myself young and stupid, 
But lately I feel old and desperate
I find it kind of weird how you find yourself 
When you have no one
I look for the right things in all the wrong places
The saddest part is I've been distant since I was sixteen
It keeps me up in bed
I'm stuck here with all the choices I've made 
And the chances I was too afraid to take
I found myself in a late night drives
Without a destination
All I had were thoughts about the past
And a list of my favorite songs to keep me company
But I still struggle and lose myself everyday
I always find myself lost in every line of all these songs
But I felt better when I saw that this is life
And in life were gonna cry
In life were gonna lose sleep
Were gonna feel helpless
But thats how its got to be 
When you lose yourself you'll find what you're looking for
I'm growing past who I used to be
As the night goes on 
I go from feeling out of place to feeling like a ghost
You miss me when I'm gone
But when I'm around it's like I'm hidden behind the paint on the walls
The loneliness will keep me warm tonight
It'll keep me warm seeing as you won't
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more than this
If the open road is my home I'm never leaving
All of the small towns make me throw away my biggest fears
And the big cities make the fucked up stuff feel smaller
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more than this
When I'm not here does anyone miss my secondhand smoke?
Do you wonder where I am or who I'm with?
Call me a mid-twenty sob story
I can't change the way I feel
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more,
Looking for something more
You were easy on my eyes
You were heavy on my heart
I never thought I'd live to see today
You're still in my mind
But not in my chest
I'm a little worn out since you fucking tore me down
You made me believe we had something
I guess that I was wrong
I thought I would be numb to this by now
I guess I was wrong
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
Stick with me or don't stick around at all
I was the boy who was too scared and ran away
I was the glue that never dried
You were the girl that made up her mind
And left me all alone to die
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
I'll sit on my basement floor
Turn off all the lights and try to not think about you
Just know that when I'm down there
I'll know that I won't be running through your mind
You were easy on my eyes
You were heavy on my heart
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
And I'll get through the winter without you
You made me believe we had something
Well I guess that I was wrong
I'm treated like an old book
That was left on the shelf
Everyone underlined what they wanted to read
And forgot the rest
My spine was left worn out and bent
So just take what you want from me
And forget the rest
It really weirds me out 
Because I never thought I'd be where I am today
My bones want to tear out of my skin
This isn't where I want to be
Getting older scares the shit out of me
I'm an old book
It's one of those nights where I'm scared to walk to my basement
These four walls, feel like they're caving in
There's pictures of you and me hidden behind my couch
I'll be waiting for the sun to shine through my window well
Am I trying to forget you or just cover you up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
I used to have an escape
But I ripped the map up a long time ago
So I'll lie to myself and say that I don't care at all
You'll always be hidden in the basement of everything I love
Am I trying to forget you or just cover you up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
The only time that I feel fine
Is when I'm parked in front of my house with tears in my eyes
I find comfort in weakness because it's always there for me
You'll always be hidden in the basement
Of everything I love
Are you trying to forget me or did you cover me up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
I can't believe you've got the nerve to say you love me
Then you left me for dead
I don't love you anymore
I hope you're happy since I don't know you anymore
You were a part of me 
And now you're just nothing but a memory
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
Now I'm just like the pictures that you take
I'm nothing but something that once was
Like colors that fade away in the sunlight
They're nothing special like they used to be
They're gone and they're never coming back
No, they're never coming back
I'm gone and I'm never coming back
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
I woke up today and realized that what we had is dead
I'm just a pile of lifeless bones to you
I've spent too many years thinking about somebody 
That doesn't even think about me
Thinking about somebody that doesn't even think about me
Thinking about somebody That doesn't even think about... 
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
Maybe this place is the same...
And we're just changing
Maybe this place is the same...
And we're just changing
I'm driving on state lines pretending you're standing there
But I know your feet will never be where my eyes fall again
Moving on is something I've always had trouble with
But this year I swear I'll get past it
If I had a backyard I would bury all my memories of you in it
Everything that we had would die right down in the dirt
I wish I had the guts to say this to your face
But the past five years took everything I had and ripped it out of me
You used to make me feel like I was something
Now you make me feel like absolutely nothing
I want to fall asleep and wake up four years ago
We were just kids who didn't know what love was
Or what we were digging ourselves into
I want to know if you ever hear 
All of these sad fucking songs I write about you
I wish I had the guts to say this to your face
But the past five years took everything I had and ripped it out of me
You used to make me feel like I was something
Now you make me feel like absolutely nothing
I know you probably hate who I've become
I'm just young and stupid, 
But that's the way I always want to be
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone 
You wouldn't know a good thing even if it slapped the makeup right off of your face
Burn down the bridges just in time for last call
Keep digging yourself neck deep into selfishness
I doubt that you'll ever find out who you really are
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone
Keep falling over that same fucking step on your front porch
Most people learn from their mistakes
But you'll just stay here tripping on the same mistakes
You always do
No one's knocked you off your feet, they say what you want to hear
You're living proof that we don't always get what we deserve
But you're really nothing special
Just another crack in the sidewalk
You never meant anything to me
Or anyone for more than one night
No one's gonna stick around for when you're broken down and blacked out
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone
Keep falling over that same fucking step on your front porch
Most people learn from their mistakes
But you'll just stay here tripping on the same mistakes
You always do
Throw away your early twenties giving up on everyone and everything around you
It never came so easy
Throw away your early twenties giving up on everyone and everything around you
It never came so easy
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone
Keep falling over that same fucking step on your front porch
Most people learn from their mistakes
But you'll just stay here tripping on the same mistakes
You always do
You used to make me feel like I could walk on water
Now most nights I'm just sinking down and down
You're the reason why I can't listen to the same songs I used to
I write songs about you all the time
I bet I don't run through your mind
I've given up on you, but it still hurts to know you're not alone
Don't worry, I'll keep out of your life and stay awake at night
It's 4am and you're keeping me from closing these sleepy eyes
Does the thought of me keep you up at night?
Like the light on the ceiling of your bedroom
Lately, my dog's the only one around that listens to my problems
It's been a lonely year 
I write songs about you all the time
I bet I don't run through your mind
I've given up on you, but it still hurts to know you're not alone
Don't worry, I'll keep out of your life and stay awake at night
With just my skin and bones
It hurts to know you're not alone
I've given up on you, and my skin, and my bones
Spit in my face, tell me I didn't mean what I said
I'll take those words with me when I'm dead
Open your mouth and contradict everything you said last summer
I don't even know you anymore, anymore
You really fucked me up this time for good, even though you didn't mean to
When the weather clears, that sweatshirt weather won't keep you warm like I do
You'll be thinking of my sleepy eyes and bony knees
You'll be thinking of me
Maybe I'll run away from home, fake my own death and see if you really care
A week goes by, I doubt you'll be waiting around for me at all
No matter how many times I walk up my driveway, you won't be there
You're nowhere to be found because everything you said was a lie
You really fucked me up this time for good, even though you didn't mean to
When the weather clears, that sweatshirt weather won't keep you warm like I do
You'll be thinking of my sleepy eyes and bony knees
You'll be thinking of me
You wanted me when I was running away
I needed you when I ripped your heart out
I can't count the times we fell apart
We can't go back, it's not the same
You really fucked me up this time for good, even though you didn't mean to
When the weather clears, that sweatshirt weather won't keep you warm like I do
You'll be thinking of my sleepy eyes and bony knees
You'll be thinking of me
When something's fallen apart as many times as us
I can't put it back together, it's not the same
This time around I wasn't honest enough with how I really felt
I'll spend the winter blending into the streets and sidewalks that make up this town
At least it gave me someone else to write another one of these sad fucking songs about
You're just another sad song to me
I've got this lonely night and Jimmy Eat World
I never had you and you told me I never did
The truth is you won't even be there when I can't stand on my own two feet
You won't be here
I saw right through you on my basement floor
But could you even see past my chest?
Could you ever feel past these hands?
Your intentions were only skin deep
Mine weren't honest enough to fall past my teeth
I've got this lonely night and Jimmy Eat World
I never had you and you told me I never did
The truth is you won't even be there when I can't stand on my own two feet
You won't be here
Will I ever know how it feels to be home again?
I've been told that home is where the heart is
If that's the case, I've never been home 
I've got this lonely night and Jimmy Eat World
I never had you and you told me I never did
The truth is you won't even be there when I can't stand on my own two feet
You won't be here
I've been up spending every late night in my car listening to all these sad songs
I know it sounds weird but they're helping me move past all these things running through my head
I'll blame the Midwest and sleepy eyes
I'm not where I should be
I'm not what I could be
But I'm not who I was
Nostalgia gets the best of me
When I wake up it's the same day
It fucks me up and makes me miss who I used to be
All I have are thoughts of me from back when I was eighteen and my bony knees
Don't want it to be like my teenage years
I was naive and weak back then without much trouble on my shoulders
If I don't break, I won't know how to put myself back together
Nostalgia gets the best of me
When I wake up it's the same day
It fucks me up and makes me miss who I used to be
All I have are thoughts of me from back when I was eighteen and my bony knees
If you never break, you'll never know how 
If you never break, you'll never know 
If you never break, you'll never know how to put yourself back together
Nostalgia gets the best of me
When I wake up it's the same day
It fucks me up and makes me miss who I used to be
All I have are thoughts of me from back when I was eighteen and my bony knees
Growing up is giving up
I'll sleep sideways on the bed in my moms basement 
It's where I feel at home
You'll sleep with regret and no heart left in your chest
I don't want to end up like you
Your eyes are set on what you'll never have
There's days I feel like a different person 
But I always come back to who I really am 
The American dream is dead, I'm still just a kid
Balancing on the sidewalks of this suburban town
Maybe this year I'll be able to stand up on my feet
Or maybe I'll fall again
I never want to grow out of this skin
That's been dragged through the dirt 
That's what made me find happiness 
My thumbs are broken but I'll take these broken thumbs 
Over your grip on an empty life
Your empty life
I've spent the end of my summer
Listening to these songs I know you don't like
I've been wondering where you are and who you're with
We used to lay on your kitchen floor at two a.m.
I was forty miles away from my house but I never felt so at home
I was forty miles away from my house 
You never called before you left to move west
I was just dead weight pulling you down
I'll move forward without the person I need
When somethings fallen apart as many times as us
I can't put it back together it's not the same
You still run through my head every night
When I lay in bed
You used to cover up the cigarette burn on the passenger seat
of my car
Now there's just empty coffee cups 
And long drives by myself
If you wore your personality on your skin, no one would take a second look
You were shallow when we met and you still are
The water won't be coming down anytime soon to change that
Loneliness keeps me warm at night and that's okay with me
I'd rather be alone in this bed made for two than listen to you and your judgement
Don't act like you're better than me
We're both fools lost in this cold world
You might not fall as much as I do, but if I look close enough I can find the scars on your knees
I can find the bags under your eyes that carry too much for you to handle
I'm starting to think that you're the reason why everyone left
So stop pointing your finger
You don't even really know me, not at all
You don't even really know me
Don't act like you're better than me
We're both fools lost in this cold world
You might not fall as much as I do, but if I look close enough I can find the scars on your knees
I can find the bags under your eyes that carry too much for you to handle
I said I'm selfish, I'm a liar and I'm broken
Shit runs through my head every day that I would never tell anyone
You're just like me
The only difference is that I'm honest enough to scream my flaws in the lines of this song
So much has changed back home since you left without packing all your things 
I always drive past your house hoping you'll be sitting on your porch
I still smell the smoke on your clothes 
And I can still hear those secondhand stories fall off your tongue
It's just not the same around here without you 
Most of the time I feel like you're in over your head out there 
You ran away from the Midwest and traded it in for beaches and east coast sunsets 
Don't take in too much too soon 
Keep your chin up out there 
Don't forget where you came from and who cares about you 
Whenever you're missing home, just look at your arm 
You've got the state lines inked into your forearm 
There's still memories of you pinned on my wall 
It's just not the same around here without you 
Most of the time I feel like you're in over your head out there 
You ran away from the Midwest and traded it in for beaches and east coast sunsets 
Don't take in too much too soon 
Maybe you'll be here next year to waste the fall away, watching the leaves blow across my driveway 
We could listen to American Football and talk about high school 
Just like we did the years before
Hope you're having fun away at college since you went there to run from all your fuck ups 
You're not so good at getting away from all of the karma that lies between your tongue and cheek 
It's gotten to the point that you're the spitting image of everything I never want to be 
I gave you chance after chance and it's obvious you haven't tried at all 
By now it's safe to say that I'll be erasing every trace you left in these lines 
I'm sorry for breaking down when I should've been stitching myself back up 
You left me on the fence with nowhere to jump since you always knew that my balance was as shitty as my judgment 
I had a feeling I'd be lying in the grass left for dead 
Now I'm stuck looking at that fence 
I gave you chance after chance and it's obvious you haven't tried at all 
By now it's safe to say that I'll be erasing every trace you left in these lines 
I'm sorry for breaking down when I should've been stitching myself back up
You've become the spitting image of everything I never want to be 
You're everything I never want to be
You'll spend every Saturday night on the bathroom floor with no recollection of the night before 
You're a train wreck and everything that's in between 
Being alone doesn't seem so bad to me 
You're the type of girl that lets this whole town know when your lips come anywhere near a bottle 
All you want is the attention from every eye and ear that covers up the walls in this room 
I'd rather sleep with just my bony knees and the thought of someone that stands up straight 
I guess I'll sleep alone tonight 
You'll tell everyone you're different, but you're just a shade of grey that never stuck out to anybody 
Fast forward to 2am and the walls aren't spinning around enough for you to forget your ex-boyfriend and all of your shitty friends 
You say you'll keep it together, but I know you're gonna make those walls fall down 
They always do 
I'd rather sleep with just my bony knees and the thought of someone that stands up straight 
I guess I'll sleep alone tonight 
You'll tell everyone you're different, but you're just a shade of grey that never stuck out to anybody 
I'd rather sleep with just my bony knees and the thought of someone that stands up straight 
I guess I'll sleep alone 
I'd rather sleep with just my bony knees and the thought of someone that stands up straight 
I guess I'll sleep alone tonight 
You'll tell everyone you're different, but you're just a shade of grey that never stuck out to anybody
I don't really think that I'm ready for another Chicago winter 
So you can stop making my bones feel cold 
I swear that emptiness lives inside your chest 
You're the reason you fell far away from what brought out your best 
Don't get me wrong, I wish a lot of things were the way they used to be 
The streets that used to make me feel alive just make me feel alone 
The holes in the wall get bigger every year 
It's hard to think that some people in this world look at me with the same eyes as yours 
I've been breaking all ten fingers for you and you wouldn't even lift one up for me 
Appreciation's something you lost in the dirt that's on your hands and knees 
But I'm never gonna be just a hole in the wall 
You can anchor down your feet and say fuck the past and everyone that dragged you here 
I'm not putting myself on a pedestal 
You need to stand up for yourself and who you claim you used to be 
It's hard to think that some people in this world look at me with the same eyes as yours 
I've been breaking all ten fingers for you and you wouldn't even lift one up for me 
Appreciation's something you lost in the dirt that's on your hands and knees 
Anchor down your feet, say fuck the past and everyone that dragged you here 
Just stand up for yourself and who you claim you used to be 
It's hard to think that some people in this world look at me with the same eyes as yours 
I've been breaking all ten fingers for you and you wouldn't even lift one up for me 
Appreciation's something you lost in the dirt that's on your hands and knees
 

I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable

But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.

"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want
Knock me down
I'm not sure I have it in me to get back up
To be who I am seems exhausting anyway
You have a lot in common with my conscience
You both erase my confidence
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Back and forth
Between some kind of vague attachment to yesterday
And never knowing what form of myself I'll get today (to get today)
I'll always be a faded sign in your eyes
No matter what the point of view (point of view)
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
I'm not here
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want to hear
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Would you notice I'm not here
Am I telling myself the truth?
I'm used to pretending to be strong and clueless
Am I doing this right by you?
I seem to be coming off as wrong and ruthless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I changing my mind again?
All this indecision makes me shift my focus
Is the tension my only friend?
Anxiety holds my hand when life gets hopeless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I telling myself the truth about my self-esteem
And how others place their worth in me?
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
(The eyes of someone else)
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
Yeah, I'll keep smiling on the surface
(Am I telling myself the truth?)
"Smiling On The Surface" is the 3rd song released from the album "Composure". It was premiered on June 18, 2018.
Swallowing a feeling
Counting cracks across the ceiling
Never reached the depths of them before
Finding flaws in every format
I know but haven't shown that
I could pick myself up off the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Redefine rock bottom with these empty orange bottles
Never felt so paralysed before (never felt this paralysed)
We're all looking for some answers
With the hangman's broken lantern
Growing ever closer to the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Why do I, why do I, feel so damn cold?
Why am I, why am I, still so low?
Why should I, why should I, get up or get out?
Why should I?
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
Soft spoken, if ever out loud
These days not much gets out
My mind digs graves through the past
But never takes time to finish the act
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
No matter how cold it might get
My bed sheets are laced with regret
I try to fill in the lines
Rework the plans for a better design
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Here I am, bearing every burden
Here I am, showing every worry
To the world
To the world
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try
I'm at best your second option
Like a key under the mat
Are my emotions hard to read?
Seems I'm good at hiding
Reality
You disregard the consequences
Always seem to shift the blame
You burn the bridge and then I build it
Seems you're good at hiding
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
You make me feel helpless
Like a bird with broken wings
Forcing me to be more selfless
Lean on me, don't knock me over
It seems we're good at hiding
It seems we're good at fighting
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
I'm all alone
I feel sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
I'm all alone
I'm feeling sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
(There's nothing I can do)
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
Is there any chance you could cut me some slack?
Because I've been hanging for a while
From this withered rope
Forcing every sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
What could I ask that you help me hold back
Cause I've been falling for a while
Down this fucking slope
Losing any sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
There's a collage of photos framed
Dating '93 to '95
Though all it shows me is that
I'm just a bad seed
Falling off the family tree
I've got more complaints
More than pleasantries to say
Every monument is idly arranged
Every figure that has ever held importance in my life
I find nobody is who I pictured them to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the faces in reflections of the past
I feel so close but I can't reach through the glass
My life burns out and flickers like the end of a cigarette
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the light in your eyes
Turn the blind eye (Turn the blind eye)
"Why are you hurting me" she screamed from her death bed
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
It's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
The tears run down your cheekbones
I feel sorry for you
But I'm too fucking selfish to say I do
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be different
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Today I ripped myself wide open
And I saw that my heart isn't as fucked as I recalled
It's still flawed and
It's sorely stitched to my old ways
I thought it was buried, but it's just stuck
To my old ways
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be something else
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Shaking in the driver's seat
Staring at the dashboard
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
Please just stay
Please just stay
You see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
To take a chance on me
To take a chance
I still see us sitting on that old couch
'Til the sun comes up
Listening to sad songs
We spent our time with smiles on our faces
I know it sounds selfish but I'll miss those days
I know it sounds selfish
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
The Fall leaves flying through the driveway
Keep triggering these memories of you
I'm torn apart with how our lives are changing
I'm sure it sounds selfish, I'm just being honest
I know it sounds selfish
But I'm trying to be honest
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
Let's go back to when thing weren't complicated
Let's go back to all those old dashboard songs
Let's go back to smoking on the side of my old house
We can never go back, we'll never go back
We'll never go back
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
I know it sounds selfish
I'm just being honest
I can't fix everything around me
I can't make everybody happy
And it'll be okay
Show me how to be something other than nostalgic
I want to feel inspired and innocent again
I just want to be worth your time
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Lately when I'm alone I keep thinking about the past
I'm trying to feel weak in my knees again
I want to stand up straight like when I graduated
I just want to be
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Do you remember when you saw right through my selfish skin?
Do you remember when I ignored everything you did?
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
It'll be okay
We rush through our lives
Just to feel some kind of pride
Dismissing actualities is making matters worse
The ink will fade, but won't go away
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
I live in the middle of a lake
And I don't know how to swim
I've isolated everything
Everywhere I go I am consistently alone
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
Cautions only ever made me worry
You know that cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
The patience I once had is running away with my youth
Away in its hands
I've been neglecting who I am
That's just who I was back then
Don't need to be perfect, just happy
I'm still a lost boy
I'm still a lost boy
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
Every once in a while I listen to Death Cab and think about how it used to be 
We thought that we knew the answers
When no one was asking
Asking the questions 
I'm still a lost boy 
I'm still a lost boy 
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
It feels like I've been taking the long way for a while now
Haven't been at home in more years than I care to say
I keep letting my past cover what the present shouldn't be
What I shouldn't be
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
Staring out the window in my bedroom makes me think back
I see me as a boy out there
Lying in the grass
Singing songs with all the wrong notes
And graduating high school as my mom cries
I'm writing the same song over and over again
And feeling lost
I've always felt so lost
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I clenched the wheel the whole way home from Cleveland
With nothing more than my eyes half way open
And my hand smelling like smoke
Each mile I drive gets me closer to the streets that made me feel alone
I'm out of place and it doesn't feel wrong
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I care too much
While you don't even care at all
It's just sad that you don't even care
I walk up the stairs to your apartment and I feel small
The lowest feelings and even lower standards
Pictures of simple times are on the top shelf
You lie to me and say you're happy with the way things are
With the way things are
It's just sad, oh it's sad that you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I spent so much damn time trying to move forward
It hurts me to watch you falling backwards
Brave your life
Finding solutions, not making excuses
Find solutions and stop waiting for excuses
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I care too much, while you don't even care at all
A bit much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different
Don't settle because you're scared
You know I pictured things to be different
I pictured things to be different for you
For you
Could you stay here 'til I fall asleep?
We'll pretend that we could make each other feel complete
I'm looking for something that's not inside of you
Will you think of me when you drive home?
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
Last night I closed my eyes
And thought about someone that wasn't you
The weight of the world slipped off my shoulders
And weighed my back to the floor
It isn't where you want to be
I know this isn't where you want to be
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
You tell me I'm broken
As I stare out my window at the street lights
I walk outside and I sit in the shade at 3am
And I feel whole again
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
And I know we're disconnected
I'm getting pretty good at leaving, my patience isn't wearing thin
Autumn never ends in my head, no matter how far I've been
It feels like everybody is the branch and I'm the leaves
Falling from the top of every leafless tree
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
All I see is the past two years before I hit the ground
Time is moving slower on the way down (on the way down)
Save your time spent wondering what's going through my mind
Let me go before you see me following behind
I'll save you from myself
Just let me go
I'll save you from myself
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
I've learned that it's okay to be selfish
It keeps me from falling apart at the seams
Stuck is where I feel in place
A feeling I'll embrace
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
So much for bad luck
If I built a boat with apologies I've got
I'd have a sorry looking raft
It always rains
But it's nice to see
That someone else is sad
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
The coin's faced up
But I'm not feeling any better
A soap box made for every single fuck up
It's tough seeing where I am
Instead of where I'm from
My roots can get loose
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
Can you find your calling if nothing is calling for you?
I'm coughing up a lung trying to get rid of you
To get rid of you
To get rid of you
Can you find your calling
If nothing's calling for you?
For you?
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
When I heard my parents cry
I realized that we're all lost kids
Trying to find our way home
Blood is thicker than water
And I still feel like everyone I love forgot how to swim
At least there are pictures of my sister and me
Hanging on the wall in my garage
They always give me peace of mind
They always give me peace of mind
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I'm starting to see that
We're always changing
It's just so weird to think that we're always changing
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
I never spent my youth thinking of half the shit I'd go through
Living in the past never helped me
Last night I drove past the house that I grew up in
And tried to find that happiness
Living in the past never helped me
Or anyone move forward
There's no love, no growth for me here
Anymore, anymore
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I know this place is the same and that I'm changing
And I'm just
When I get stopped by a train on my drive home
I don't let it get to me like the rest of the world
I smile and think about how much I've grown over this year
It gives me time to open my mind and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that train
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine without you
I've laid to rest the shit that was always out of my hands
I finally sent all my skeletons away
Like everything I couldn't fix and people I couldn't change
Konstantine always tore me apart and made me cry
Now I hear that song and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that...
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine
Happiness, won't get me over this
Happiness, won't get me over anything, over anything 
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I spend my nights thinking the worst
And telling myself that everything's going to work out
I keep kicking myself in the mouth
Opening up every cut that should be a scar by now
I need the hope I always tell my friends about
I need the hope I always tell my friends about
I sleep with the TV on, it covers up my feelings about the past
Here I am lying awake thinking about how things used to be
I'm sick and tired
I'm sick and tired of being at the same old place in my head
Give me peace of mind
I always backtrack to my old self
When I'm holding on to despair and cracks in my life
I'm holding on when I need to let go
I sleep with the TV on, it covers up my feelings about the past
Here I am lying awake thinking about how things used to be
Doubt is the soil that fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
Doubt is the soil that fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
Doubt is the story of how fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
I'm dirty from head to toe
I'm dirty from head to toe
Change holds me down to the places I don't want to be
When I wake up I look in the mirror and I see
The person that's been scaring me away from moving on
And getting out of my head
I end my nights in the same spot that I told myself I would leave
I want to come home and have it be like it was before I left
I'm starting to see that I keep living alone in the past
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
I can't shake it off
Always a fight between my past,
My head, and my heart, you can cut me up
And spread me all over Illinois
I can't, I can't find myself
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
I'm stuck and I feel like I'm the only one
I end my nights in the same spot that I told myself I would leave
I want to come home and have it be like it was before I left
I'm starting to see that I keep living alone in the past
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
Did I get left behind?
Or is everybody else just hiding that they're lost
Loneliness will never leave my mind
Loneliness will never leave my mind
Did I get left behind?
Or is everybody else just hiding that they're lost
Just when I think I need someone, 
They wrap their arms around my old bones 
And I start breaking apart
I walk away from anyone that cares about me
But I swear my skin's not as rough as I make it out to be
The saddest part is I've been distant since I was sixteen
It keeps me up in bed
I'm stuck here with all the choices I've made 
And the chances I was too afraid to take
I've called myself young and stupid, 
But lately I feel old and desperate
I find it kind of weird how you find yourself 
When you have no one
I look for the right things in all the wrong places
The saddest part is I've been distant since I was sixteen
It keeps me up in bed
I'm stuck here with all the choices I've made 
And the chances I was too afraid to take
I found myself in a late night drives
Without a destination
All I had were thoughts about the past
And a list of my favorite songs to keep me company
But I still struggle and lose myself everyday
I always find myself lost in every line of all these songs
But I felt better when I saw that this is life
And in life were gonna cry
In life were gonna lose sleep
Were gonna feel helpless
But thats how its got to be 
When you lose yourself you'll find what you're looking for
I'm growing past who I used to be
As the night goes on 
I go from feeling out of place to feeling like a ghost
You miss me when I'm gone
But when I'm around it's like I'm hidden behind the paint on the walls
The loneliness will keep me warm tonight
It'll keep me warm seeing as you won't
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more than this
If the open road is my home I'm never leaving
All of the small towns make me throw away my biggest fears
And the big cities make the fucked up stuff feel smaller
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more than this
When I'm not here does anyone miss my secondhand smoke?
Do you wonder where I am or who I'm with?
Call me a mid-twenty sob story
I can't change the way I feel
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more,
Looking for something more
You were easy on my eyes
You were heavy on my heart
I never thought I'd live to see today
You're still in my mind
But not in my chest
I'm a little worn out since you fucking tore me down
You made me believe we had something
I guess that I was wrong
I thought I would be numb to this by now
I guess I was wrong
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
Stick with me or don't stick around at all
I was the boy who was too scared and ran away
I was the glue that never dried
You were the girl that made up her mind
And left me all alone to die
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
I'll sit on my basement floor
Turn off all the lights and try to not think about you
Just know that when I'm down there
I'll know that I won't be running through your mind
You were easy on my eyes
You were heavy on my heart
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
And I'll get through the winter without you
You made me believe we had something
Well I guess that I was wrong
I'm treated like an old book
That was left on the shelf
Everyone underlined what they wanted to read
And forgot the rest
My spine was left worn out and bent
So just take what you want from me
And forget the rest
It really weirds me out 
Because I never thought I'd be where I am today
My bones want to tear out of my skin
This isn't where I want to be
Getting older scares the shit out of me
I'm an old book
It's one of those nights where I'm scared to walk to my basement
These four walls, feel like they're caving in
There's pictures of you and me hidden behind my couch
I'll be waiting for the sun to shine through my window well
Am I trying to forget you or just cover you up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
I used to have an escape
But I ripped the map up a long time ago
So I'll lie to myself and say that I don't care at all
You'll always be hidden in the basement of everything I love
Am I trying to forget you or just cover you up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
The only time that I feel fine
Is when I'm parked in front of my house with tears in my eyes
I find comfort in weakness because it's always there for me
You'll always be hidden in the basement
Of everything I love
Are you trying to forget me or did you cover me up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
I can't believe you've got the nerve to say you love me
Then you left me for dead
I don't love you anymore
I hope you're happy since I don't know you anymore
You were a part of me 
And now you're just nothing but a memory
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
Now I'm just like the pictures that you take
I'm nothing but something that once was
Like colors that fade away in the sunlight
They're nothing special like they used to be
They're gone and they're never coming back
No, they're never coming back
I'm gone and I'm never coming back
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
I woke up today and realized that what we had is dead
I'm just a pile of lifeless bones to you
I've spent too many years thinking about somebody 
That doesn't even think about me
Thinking about somebody that doesn't even think about me
Thinking about somebody That doesn't even think about... 
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
Maybe this place is the same...
And we're just changing
Maybe this place is the same...
And we're just changing
I'm driving on state lines pretending you're standing there
But I know your feet will never be where my eyes fall again
Moving on is something I've always had trouble with
But this year I swear I'll get past it
If I had a backyard I would bury all my memories of you in it
Everything that we had would die right down in the dirt
I wish I had the guts to say this to your face
But the past five years took everything I had and ripped it out of me
You used to make me feel like I was something
Now you make me feel like absolutely nothing
I want to fall asleep and wake up four years ago
We were just kids who didn't know what love was
Or what we were digging ourselves into
I want to know if you ever hear 
All of these sad fucking songs I write about you
I wish I had the guts to say this to your face
But the past five years took everything I had and ripped it out of me
You used to make me feel like I was something
Now you make me feel like absolutely nothing
I know you probably hate who I've become
I'm just young and stupid, 
But that's the way I always want to be
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone 
You wouldn't know a good thing even if it slapped the makeup right off of your face
Burn down the bridges just in time for last call
Keep digging yourself neck deep into selfishness
I doubt that you'll ever find out who you really are
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone
Keep falling over that same fucking step on your front porch
Most people learn from their mistakes
But you'll just stay here tripping on the same mistakes
You always do
No one's knocked you off your feet, they say what you want to hear
You're living proof that we don't always get what we deserve
But you're really nothing special
Just another crack in the sidewalk
You never meant anything to me
Or anyone for more than one night
No one's gonna stick around for when you're broken down and blacked out
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone
Keep falling over that same fucking step on your front porch
Most people learn from their mistakes
But you'll just stay here tripping on the same mistakes
You always do
Throw away your early twenties giving up on everyone and everything around you
It never came so easy
Throw away your early twenties giving up on everyone and everything around you
It never came so easy
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone
Keep falling over that same fucking step on your front porch
Most people learn from their mistakes
But you'll just stay here tripping on the same mistakes
You always do
You used to make me feel like I could walk on water
Now most nights I'm just sinking down and down
You're the reason why I can't listen to the same songs I used to
I write songs about you all the time
I bet I don't run through your mind
I've given up on you, but it still hurts to know you're not alone
Don't worry, I'll keep out of your life and stay awake at night
It's 4am and you're keeping me from closing these sleepy eyes
Does the thought of me keep you up at night?
Like the light on the ceiling of your bedroom
Lately, my dog's the only one around that listens to my problems
It's been a lonely year 
I write songs about you all the time
I bet I don't run through your mind
I've given up on you, but it still hurts to know you're not alone
Don't worry, I'll keep out of your life and stay awake at night
With just my skin and bones
It hurts to know you're not alone
I've given up on you, and my skin, and my bones
Spit in my face, tell me I didn't mean what I said
I'll take those words with me when I'm dead
Open your mouth and contradict everything you said last summer
I don't even know you anymore, anymore
You really fucked me up this time for good, even though you didn't mean to
When the weather clears, that sweatshirt weather won't keep you warm like I do
You'll be thinking of my sleepy eyes and bony knees
You'll be thinking of me
Maybe I'll run away from home, fake my own death and see if you really care
A week goes by, I doubt you'll be waiting around for me at all
No matter how many times I walk up my driveway, you won't be there
You're nowhere to be found because everything you said was a lie
You really fucked me up this time for good, even though you didn't mean to
When the weather clears, that sweatshirt weather won't keep you warm like I do
You'll be thinking of my sleepy eyes and bony knees
You'll be thinking of me
You wanted me when I was running away
I needed you when I ripped your heart out
I can't count the times we fell apart
We can't go back, it's not the same
You really fucked me up this time for good, even though you didn't mean to
When the weather clears, that sweatshirt weather won't keep you warm like I do
You'll be thinking of my sleepy eyes and bony knees
You'll be thinking of me
When something's fallen apart as many times as us
I can't put it back together, it's not the same
This time around I wasn't honest enough with how I really felt
I'll spend the winter blending into the streets and sidewalks that make up this town
At least it gave me someone else to write another one of these sad fucking songs about
You're just another sad song to me
I've got this lonely night and Jimmy Eat World
I never had you and you told me I never did
The truth is you won't even be there when I can't stand on my own two feet
You won't be here
I saw right through you on my basement floor
But could you even see past my chest?
Could you ever feel past these hands?
Your intentions were only skin deep
Mine weren't honest enough to fall past my teeth
I've got this lonely night and Jimmy Eat World
I never had you and you told me I never did
The truth is you won't even be there when I can't stand on my own two feet
You won't be here
Will I ever know how it feels to be home again?
I've been told that home is where the heart is
If that's the case, I've never been home 
I've got this lonely night and Jimmy Eat World
I never had you and you told me I never did
The truth is you won't even be there when I can't stand on my own two feet
You won't be here
I've been up spending every late night in my car listening to all these sad songs
I know it sounds weird but they're helping me move past all these things running through my head
I'll blame the Midwest and sleepy eyes
I'm not where I should be
I'm not what I could be
But I'm not who I was
Nostalgia gets the best of me
When I wake up it's the same day
It fucks me up and makes me miss who I used to be
All I have are thoughts of me from back when I was eighteen and my bony knees
Don't want it to be like my teenage years
I was naive and weak back then without much trouble on my shoulders
If I don't break, I won't know how to put myself back together
Nostalgia gets the best of me
When I wake up it's the same day
It fucks me up and makes me miss who I used to be
All I have are thoughts of me from back when I was eighteen and my bony knees
If you never break, you'll never know how 
If you never break, you'll never know 
If you never break, you'll never know how to put yourself back together
Nostalgia gets the best of me
When I wake up it's the same day
It fucks me up and makes me miss who I used to be
All I have are thoughts of me from back when I was eighteen and my bony knees
Growing up is giving up
I'll sleep sideways on the bed in my moms basement 
It's where I feel at home
You'll sleep with regret and no heart left in your chest
I don't want to end up like you
Your eyes are set on what you'll never have
There's days I feel like a different person 
But I always come back to who I really am 
The American dream is dead, I'm still just a kid
Balancing on the sidewalks of this suburban town
Maybe this year I'll be able to stand up on my feet
Or maybe I'll fall again
I never want to grow out of this skin
That's been dragged through the dirt 
That's what made me find happiness 
My thumbs are broken but I'll take these broken thumbs 
Over your grip on an empty life
Your empty life
I've spent the end of my summer
Listening to these songs I know you don't like
I've been wondering where you are and who you're with
We used to lay on your kitchen floor at two a.m.
I was forty miles away from my house but I never felt so at home
I was forty miles away from my house 
You never called before you left to move west
I was just dead weight pulling you down
I'll move forward without the person I need
When somethings fallen apart as many times as us
I can't put it back together it's not the same
You still run through my head every night
When I lay in bed
You used to cover up the cigarette burn on the passenger seat
of my car
Now there's just empty coffee cups 
And long drives by myself
If you wore your personality on your skin, no one would take a second look
You were shallow when we met and you still are
The water won't be coming down anytime soon to change that
Loneliness keeps me warm at night and that's okay with me
I'd rather be alone in this bed made for two than listen to you and your judgement
Don't act like you're better than me
We're both fools lost in this cold world
You might not fall as much as I do, but if I look close enough I can find the scars on your knees
I can find the bags under your eyes that carry too much for you to handle
I'm starting to think that you're the reason why everyone left
So stop pointing your finger
You don't even really know me, not at all
You don't even really know me
Don't act like you're better than me
We're both fools lost in this cold world
You might not fall as much as I do, but if I look close enough I can find the scars on your knees
I can find the bags under your eyes that carry too much for you to handle
I said I'm selfish, I'm a liar and I'm broken
Shit runs through my head every day that I would never tell anyone
You're just like me
The only difference is that I'm honest enough to scream my flaws in the lines of this song
So much has changed back home since you left without packing all your things 
I always drive past your house hoping you'll be sitting on your porch
I still smell the smoke on your clothes 
And I can still hear those secondhand stories fall off your tongue
It's just not the same around here without you 
Most of the time I feel like you're in over your head out there 
You ran away from the Midwest and traded it in for beaches and east coast sunsets 
Don't take in too much too soon 
Keep your chin up out there 
Don't forget where you came from and who cares about you 
Whenever you're missing home, just look at your arm 
You've got the state lines inked into your forearm 
There's still memories of you pinned on my wall 
It's just not the same around here without you 
Most of the time I feel like you're in over your head out there 
You ran away from the Midwest and traded it in for beaches and east coast sunsets 
Don't take in too much too soon 
Maybe you'll be here next year to waste the fall away, watching the leaves blow across my driveway 
We could listen to American Football and talk about high school 
Just like we did the years before
Hope you're having fun away at college since you went there to run from all your fuck ups 
You're not so good at getting away from all of the karma that lies between your tongue and cheek 
It's gotten to the point that you're the spitting image of everything I never want to be 
I gave you chance after chance and it's obvious you haven't tried at all 
By now it's safe to say that I'll be erasing every trace you left in these lines 
I'm sorry for breaking down when I should've been stitching myself back up 
You left me on the fence with nowhere to jump since you always knew that my balance was as shitty as my judgment 
I had a feeling I'd be lying in the grass left for dead 
Now I'm stuck looking at that fence 
I gave you chance after chance and it's obvious you haven't tried at all 
By now it's safe to say that I'll be erasing every trace you left in these lines 
I'm sorry for breaking down when I should've been stitching myself back up
You've become the spitting image of everything I never want to be 
You're everything I never want to be
You'll spend every Saturday night on the bathroom floor with no recollection of the night before 
You're a train wreck and everything that's in between 
Being alone doesn't seem so bad to me 
You're the type of girl that lets this whole town know when your lips come anywhere near a bottle 
All you want is the attention from every eye and ear that covers up the walls in this room 
I'd rather sleep with just my bony knees and the thought of someone that stands up straight 
I guess I'll sleep alone tonight 
You'll tell everyone you're different, but you're just a shade of grey that never stuck out to anybody 
Fast forward to 2am and the walls aren't spinning around enough for you to forget your ex-boyfriend and all of your shitty friends 
You say you'll keep it together, but I know you're gonna make those walls fall down 
They always do 
I'd rather sleep with just my bony knees and the thought of someone that stands up straight 
I guess I'll sleep alone tonight 
You'll tell everyone you're different, but you're just a shade of grey that never stuck out to anybody 
I'd rather sleep with just my bony knees and the thought of someone that stands up straight 
I guess I'll sleep alone 
I'd rather sleep with just my bony knees and the thought of someone that stands up straight 
I guess I'll sleep alone tonight 
You'll tell everyone you're different, but you're just a shade of grey that never stuck out to anybody
I don't really think that I'm ready for another Chicago winter 
So you can stop making my bones feel cold 
I swear that emptiness lives inside your chest 
You're the reason you fell far away from what brought out your best 
Don't get me wrong, I wish a lot of things were the way they used to be 
The streets that used to make me feel alive just make me feel alone 
The holes in the wall get bigger every year 
It's hard to think that some people in this world look at me with the same eyes as yours 
I've been breaking all ten fingers for you and you wouldn't even lift one up for me 
Appreciation's something you lost in the dirt that's on your hands and knees 
But I'm never gonna be just a hole in the wall 
You can anchor down your feet and say fuck the past and everyone that dragged you here 
I'm not putting myself on a pedestal 
You need to stand up for yourself and who you claim you used to be 
It's hard to think that some people in this world look at me with the same eyes as yours 
I've been breaking all ten fingers for you and you wouldn't even lift one up for me 
Appreciation's something you lost in the dirt that's on your hands and knees 
Anchor down your feet, say fuck the past and everyone that dragged you here 
Just stand up for yourself and who you claim you used to be 
It's hard to think that some people in this world look at me with the same eyes as yours 
I've been breaking all ten fingers for you and you wouldn't even lift one up for me 
Appreciation's something you lost in the dirt that's on your hands and knees
You said I didn't cry out to the clouds for nothing 
You told me everything eventually works out 
That's what I'll keep telling myself 
I don't want to be jealous of the trees next to my neighbor's garage anymore 
I'll just lie in the mess I made 
Don't let me fall off the edge and break down 
Try not to forget everything I said 
Just another week and I'll pick myself up off my bony knees 
I guess it took a year to realize that what I had was everything I needed to feel okay 
But still I've got these sleepy eyes that have seen too much for me to handle 
I'm not gonna lie, my skin and bones have seen some better days 
Thirty pounds ago seems like a more stable place to stay 
I'm not gonna lie, my skin and bones have seen some better days 
I'm not gonna lie, my skin and bones have seen some better days 
Just another week and I'll pick myself up off my bony knees 
I guess it took a year to realize that what I had was everything I needed to feel okay 
But still I've got these sleepy eyes that have seen too much for me to handle 
There's no point to the floorboards in my house 
Nothing feels right 
I can't stand up without you 
Nothing feels right 
Just another week and I'll pick myself up off my bony knees 
I guess it took a year to realize that what I had was everything I needed to feel okay 
But still I've got these sleepy eyes that have seen too much for me to handle
 

I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want
Knock me down
I'm not sure I have it in me to get back up
To be who I am seems exhausting anyway
You have a lot in common with my conscience
You both erase my confidence
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Back and forth
Between some kind of vague attachment to yesterday
And never knowing what form of myself I'll get today (to get today)
I'll always be a faded sign in your eyes
No matter what the point of view (point of view)
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
I'm not here
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want to hear
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Would you notice I'm not here
Am I telling myself the truth?
I'm used to pretending to be strong and clueless
Am I doing this right by you?
I seem to be coming off as wrong and ruthless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I changing my mind again?
All this indecision makes me shift my focus
Is the tension my only friend?
Anxiety holds my hand when life gets hopeless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I telling myself the truth about my self-esteem
And how others place their worth in me?
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
(The eyes of someone else)
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
Yeah, I'll keep smiling on the surface
(Am I telling myself the truth?)
"Smiling On The Surface" is the 3rd song released from the album "Composure". It was premiered on June 18, 2018.
Swallowing a feeling
Counting cracks across the ceiling
Never reached the depths of them before
Finding flaws in every format
I know but haven't shown that
I could pick myself up off the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Redefine rock bottom with these empty orange bottles
Never felt so paralysed before (never felt this paralysed)
We're all looking for some answers
With the hangman's broken lantern
Growing ever closer to the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Why do I, why do I, feel so damn cold?
Why am I, why am I, still so low?
Why should I, why should I, get up or get out?
Why should I?
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
Soft spoken, if ever out loud
These days not much gets out
My mind digs graves through the past
But never takes time to finish the act
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
No matter how cold it might get
My bed sheets are laced with regret
I try to fill in the lines
Rework the plans for a better design
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Here I am, bearing every burden
Here I am, showing every worry
To the world
To the world
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try
I'm at best your second option
Like a key under the mat
Are my emotions hard to read?
Seems I'm good at hiding
Reality
You disregard the consequences
Always seem to shift the blame
You burn the bridge and then I build it
Seems you're good at hiding
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
You make me feel helpless
Like a bird with broken wings
Forcing me to be more selfless
Lean on me, don't knock me over
It seems we're good at hiding
It seems we're good at fighting
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
I'm all alone
I feel sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
I'm all alone
I'm feeling sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
(There's nothing I can do)
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
Is there any chance you could cut me some slack?
Because I've been hanging for a while
From this withered rope
Forcing every sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
What could I ask that you help me hold back
Cause I've been falling for a while
Down this fucking slope
Losing any sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
There's a collage of photos framed
Dating '93 to '95
Though all it shows me is that
I'm just a bad seed
Falling off the family tree
I've got more complaints
More than pleasantries to say
Every monument is idly arranged
Every figure that has ever held importance in my life
I find nobody is who I pictured them to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the faces in reflections of the past
I feel so close but I can't reach through the glass
My life burns out and flickers like the end of a cigarette
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the light in your eyes
Turn the blind eye (Turn the blind eye)
"Why are you hurting me" she screamed from her death bed
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
It's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
The tears run down your cheekbones
I feel sorry for you
But I'm too fucking selfish to say I do
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be different
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Today I ripped myself wide open
And I saw that my heart isn't as fucked as I recalled
It's still flawed and
It's sorely stitched to my old ways
I thought it was buried, but it's just stuck
To my old ways
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be something else
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Shaking in the driver's seat
Staring at the dashboard
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
Please just stay
Please just stay
You see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
To take a chance on me
To take a chance
I still see us sitting on that old couch
'Til the sun comes up
Listening to sad songs
We spent our time with smiles on our faces
I know it sounds selfish but I'll miss those days
I know it sounds selfish
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
The Fall leaves flying through the driveway
Keep triggering these memories of you
I'm torn apart with how our lives are changing
I'm sure it sounds selfish, I'm just being honest
I know it sounds selfish
But I'm trying to be honest
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
Let's go back to when thing weren't complicated
Let's go back to all those old dashboard songs
Let's go back to smoking on the side of my old house
We can never go back, we'll never go back
We'll never go back
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
I know it sounds selfish
I'm just being honest
I can't fix everything around me
I can't make everybody happy
And it'll be okay
Show me how to be something other than nostalgic
I want to feel inspired and innocent again
I just want to be worth your time
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Lately when I'm alone I keep thinking about the past
I'm trying to feel weak in my knees again
I want to stand up straight like when I graduated
I just want to be
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Do you remember when you saw right through my selfish skin?
Do you remember when I ignored everything you did?
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
It'll be okay
We rush through our lives
Just to feel some kind of pride
Dismissing actualities is making matters worse
The ink will fade, but won't go away
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
I live in the middle of a lake
And I don't know how to swim
I've isolated everything
Everywhere I go I am consistently alone
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
Cautions only ever made me worry
You know that cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
The patience I once had is running away with my youth
Away in its hands
I've been neglecting who I am
That's just who I was back then
Don't need to be perfect, just happy
I'm still a lost boy
I'm still a lost boy
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
Every once in a while I listen to Death Cab and think about how it used to be 
We thought that we knew the answers
When no one was asking
Asking the questions 
I'm still a lost boy 
I'm still a lost boy 
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
It feels like I've been taking the long way for a while now
Haven't been at home in more years than I care to say
I keep letting my past cover what the present shouldn't be
What I shouldn't be
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
Staring out the window in my bedroom makes me think back
I see me as a boy out there
Lying in the grass
Singing songs with all the wrong notes
And graduating high school as my mom cries
I'm writing the same song over and over again
And feeling lost
I've always felt so lost
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I clenched the wheel the whole way home from Cleveland
With nothing more than my eyes half way open
And my hand smelling like smoke
Each mile I drive gets me closer to the streets that made me feel alone
I'm out of place and it doesn't feel wrong
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I care too much
While you don't even care at all
It's just sad that you don't even care
I walk up the stairs to your apartment and I feel small
The lowest feelings and even lower standards
Pictures of simple times are on the top shelf
You lie to me and say you're happy with the way things are
With the way things are
It's just sad, oh it's sad that you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I spent so much damn time trying to move forward
It hurts me to watch you falling backwards
Brave your life
Finding solutions, not making excuses
Find solutions and stop waiting for excuses
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I care too much, while you don't even care at all
A bit much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different
Don't settle because you're scared
You know I pictured things to be different
I pictured things to be different for you
For you
Could you stay here 'til I fall asleep?
We'll pretend that we could make each other feel complete
I'm looking for something that's not inside of you
Will you think of me when you drive home?
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
Last night I closed my eyes
And thought about someone that wasn't you
The weight of the world slipped off my shoulders
And weighed my back to the floor
It isn't where you want to be
I know this isn't where you want to be
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
You tell me I'm broken
As I stare out my window at the street lights
I walk outside and I sit in the shade at 3am
And I feel whole again
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
And I know we're disconnected
I'm getting pretty good at leaving, my patience isn't wearing thin
Autumn never ends in my head, no matter how far I've been
It feels like everybody is the branch and I'm the leaves
Falling from the top of every leafless tree
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
All I see is the past two years before I hit the ground
Time is moving slower on the way down (on the way down)
Save your time spent wondering what's going through my mind
Let me go before you see me following behind
I'll save you from myself
Just let me go
I'll save you from myself
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
I've learned that it's okay to be selfish
It keeps me from falling apart at the seams
Stuck is where I feel in place
A feeling I'll embrace
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
So much for bad luck
If I built a boat with apologies I've got
I'd have a sorry looking raft
It always rains
But it's nice to see
That someone else is sad
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
The coin's faced up
But I'm not feeling any better
A soap box made for every single fuck up
It's tough seeing where I am
Instead of where I'm from
My roots can get loose
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
Can you find your calling if nothing is calling for you?
I'm coughing up a lung trying to get rid of you
To get rid of you
To get rid of you
Can you find your calling
If nothing's calling for you?
For you?
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
When I heard my parents cry
I realized that we're all lost kids
Trying to find our way home
Blood is thicker than water
And I still feel like everyone I love forgot how to swim
At least there are pictures of my sister and me
Hanging on the wall in my garage
They always give me peace of mind
They always give me peace of mind
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I'm starting to see that
We're always changing
It's just so weird to think that we're always changing
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
I never spent my youth thinking of half the shit I'd go through
Living in the past never helped me
Last night I drove past the house that I grew up in
And tried to find that happiness
Living in the past never helped me
Or anyone move forward
There's no love, no growth for me here
Anymore, anymore
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I know this place is the same and that I'm changing
And I'm just
When I get stopped by a train on my drive home
I don't let it get to me like the rest of the world
I smile and think about how much I've grown over this year
It gives me time to open my mind and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that train
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine without you
I've laid to rest the shit that was always out of my hands
I finally sent all my skeletons away
Like everything I couldn't fix and people I couldn't change
Konstantine always tore me apart and made me cry
Now I hear that song and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that...
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine
Happiness, won't get me over this
Happiness, won't get me over anything, over anything 
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I spend my nights thinking the worst
And telling myself that everything's going to work out
I keep kicking myself in the mouth
Opening up every cut that should be a scar by now
I need the hope I always tell my friends about
I need the hope I always tell my friends about
I sleep with the TV on, it covers up my feelings about the past
Here I am lying awake thinking about how things used to be
I'm sick and tired
I'm sick and tired of being at the same old place in my head
Give me peace of mind
I always backtrack to my old self
When I'm holding on to despair and cracks in my life
I'm holding on when I need to let go
I sleep with the TV on, it covers up my feelings about the past
Here I am lying awake thinking about how things used to be
Doubt is the soil that fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
Doubt is the soil that fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
Doubt is the story of how fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
I'm dirty from head to toe
I'm dirty from head to toe
Change holds me down to the places I don't want to be
When I wake up I look in the mirror and I see
The person that's been scaring me away from moving on
And getting out of my head
I end my nights in the same spot that I told myself I would leave
I want to come home and have it be like it was before I left
I'm starting to see that I keep living alone in the past
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
I can't shake it off
Always a fight between my past,
My head, and my heart, you can cut me up
And spread me all over Illinois
I can't, I can't find myself
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
I'm stuck and I feel like I'm the only one
I end my nights in the same spot that I told myself I would leave
I want to come home and have it be like it was before I left
I'm starting to see that I keep living alone in the past
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
Did I get left behind?
Or is everybody else just hiding that they're lost
Loneliness will never leave my mind
Loneliness will never leave my mind
Did I get left behind?
Or is everybody else just hiding that they're lost
Just when I think I need someone, 
They wrap their arms around my old bones 
And I start breaking apart
I walk away from anyone that cares about me
But I swear my skin's not as rough as I make it out to be
The saddest part is I've been distant since I was sixteen
It keeps me up in bed
I'm stuck here with all the choices I've made 
And the chances I was too afraid to take
I've called myself young and stupid, 
But lately I feel old and desperate
I find it kind of weird how you find yourself 
When you have no one
I look for the right things in all the wrong places
The saddest part is I've been distant since I was sixteen
It keeps me up in bed
I'm stuck here with all the choices I've made 
And the chances I was too afraid to take
I found myself in a late night drives
Without a destination
All I had were thoughts about the past
And a list of my favorite songs to keep me company
But I still struggle and lose myself everyday
I always find myself lost in every line of all these songs
But I felt better when I saw that this is life
And in life were gonna cry
In life were gonna lose sleep
Were gonna feel helpless
But thats how its got to be 
When you lose yourself you'll find what you're looking for
I'm growing past who I used to be
As the night goes on 
I go from feeling out of place to feeling like a ghost
You miss me when I'm gone
But when I'm around it's like I'm hidden behind the paint on the walls
The loneliness will keep me warm tonight
It'll keep me warm seeing as you won't
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more than this
If the open road is my home I'm never leaving
All of the small towns make me throw away my biggest fears
And the big cities make the fucked up stuff feel smaller
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more than this
When I'm not here does anyone miss my secondhand smoke?
Do you wonder where I am or who I'm with?
Call me a mid-twenty sob story
I can't change the way I feel
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more,
Looking for something more
You were easy on my eyes
You were heavy on my heart
I never thought I'd live to see today
You're still in my mind
But not in my chest
I'm a little worn out since you fucking tore me down
You made me believe we had something
I guess that I was wrong
I thought I would be numb to this by now
I guess I was wrong
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
Stick with me or don't stick around at all
I was the boy who was too scared and ran away
I was the glue that never dried
You were the girl that made up her mind
And left me all alone to die
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
I'll sit on my basement floor
Turn off all the lights and try to not think about you
Just know that when I'm down there
I'll know that I won't be running through your mind
You were easy on my eyes
You were heavy on my heart
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
And I'll get through the winter without you
You made me believe we had something
Well I guess that I was wrong
I'm treated like an old book
That was left on the shelf
Everyone underlined what they wanted to read
And forgot the rest
My spine was left worn out and bent
So just take what you want from me
And forget the rest
It really weirds me out 
Because I never thought I'd be where I am today
My bones want to tear out of my skin
This isn't where I want to be
Getting older scares the shit out of me
I'm an old book
It's one of those nights where I'm scared to walk to my basement
These four walls, feel like they're caving in
There's pictures of you and me hidden behind my couch
I'll be waiting for the sun to shine through my window well
Am I trying to forget you or just cover you up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
I used to have an escape
But I ripped the map up a long time ago
So I'll lie to myself and say that I don't care at all
You'll always be hidden in the basement of everything I love
Am I trying to forget you or just cover you up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
The only time that I feel fine
Is when I'm parked in front of my house with tears in my eyes
I find comfort in weakness because it's always there for me
You'll always be hidden in the basement
Of everything I love
Are you trying to forget me or did you cover me up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
I can't believe you've got the nerve to say you love me
Then you left me for dead
I don't love you anymore
I hope you're happy since I don't know you anymore
You were a part of me 
And now you're just nothing but a memory
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
Now I'm just like the pictures that you take
I'm nothing but something that once was
Like colors that fade away in the sunlight
They're nothing special like they used to be
They're gone and they're never coming back
No, they're never coming back
I'm gone and I'm never coming back
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
I woke up today and realized that what we had is dead
I'm just a pile of lifeless bones to you
I've spent too many years thinking about somebody 
That doesn't even think about me
Thinking about somebody that doesn't even think about me
Thinking about somebody That doesn't even think about... 
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
Maybe this place is the same...
And we're just changing
Maybe this place is the same...
And we're just changing
I'm driving on state lines pretending you're standing there
But I know your feet will never be where my eyes fall again
Moving on is something I've always had trouble with
But this year I swear I'll get past it
If I had a backyard I would bury all my memories of you in it
Everything that we had would die right down in the dirt
I wish I had the guts to say this to your face
But the past five years took everything I had and ripped it out of me
You used to make me feel like I was something
Now you make me feel like absolutely nothing
I want to fall asleep and wake up four years ago
We were just kids who didn't know what love was
Or what we were digging ourselves into
I want to know if you ever hear 
All of these sad fucking songs I write about you
I wish I had the guts to say this to your face
But the past five years took everything I had and ripped it out of me
You used to make me feel like I was something
Now you make me feel like absolutely nothing
I know you probably hate who I've become
I'm just young and stupid, 
But that's the way I always want to be
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone 
You wouldn't know a good thing even if it slapped the makeup right off of your face
Burn down the bridges just in time for last call
Keep digging yourself neck deep into selfishness
I doubt that you'll ever find out who you really are
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone
Keep falling over that same fucking step on your front porch
Most people learn from their mistakes
But you'll just stay here tripping on the same mistakes
You always do
No one's knocked you off your feet, they say what you want to hear
You're living proof that we don't always get what we deserve
But you're really nothing special
Just another crack in the sidewalk
You never meant anything to me
Or anyone for more than one night
No one's gonna stick around for when you're broken down and blacked out
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone
Keep falling over that same fucking step on your front porch
Most people learn from their mistakes
But you'll just stay here tripping on the same mistakes
You always do
Throw away your early twenties giving up on everyone and everything around you
It never came so easy
Throw away your early twenties giving up on everyone and everything around you
It never came so easy
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone
Keep falling over that same fucking step on your front porch
Most people learn from their mistakes
But you'll just stay here tripping on the same mistakes
You always do
You used to make me feel like I could walk on water
Now most nights I'm just sinking down and down
You're the reason why I can't listen to the same songs I used to
I write songs about you all the time
I bet I don't run through your mind
I've given up on you, but it still hurts to know you're not alone
Don't worry, I'll keep out of your life and stay awake at night
It's 4am and you're keeping me from closing these sleepy eyes
Does the thought of me keep you up at night?
Like the light on the ceiling of your bedroom
Lately, my dog's the only one around that listens to my problems
It's been a lonely year 
I write songs about you all the time
I bet I don't run through your mind
I've given up on you, but it still hurts to know you're not alone
Don't worry, I'll keep out of your life and stay awake at night
With just my skin and bones
It hurts to know you're not alone
I've given up on you, and my skin, and my bones
Spit in my face, tell me I didn't mean what I said
I'll take those words with me when I'm dead
Open your mouth and contradict everything you said last summer
I don't even know you anymore, anymore
You really fucked me up this time for good, even though you didn't mean to
When the weather clears, that sweatshirt weather won't keep you warm like I do
You'll be thinking of my sleepy eyes and bony knees
You'll be thinking of me
Maybe I'll run away from home, fake my own death and see if you really care
A week goes by, I doubt you'll be waiting around for me at all
No matter how many times I walk up my driveway, you won't be there
You're nowhere to be found because everything you said was a lie
You really fucked me up this time for good, even though you didn't mean to
When the weather clears, that sweatshirt weather won't keep you warm like I do
You'll be thinking of my sleepy eyes and bony knees
You'll be thinking of me
You wanted me when I was running away
I needed you when I ripped your heart out
I can't count the times we fell apart
We can't go back, it's not the same
You really fucked me up this time for good, even though you didn't mean to
When the weather clears, that sweatshirt weather won't keep you warm like I do
You'll be thinking of my sleepy eyes and bony knees
You'll be thinking of me
When something's fallen apart as many times as us
I can't put it back together, it's not the same
This time around I wasn't honest enough with how I really felt
I'll spend the winter blending into the streets and sidewalks that make up this town
At least it gave me someone else to write another one of these sad fucking songs about
You're just another sad song to me
I've got this lonely night and Jimmy Eat World
I never had you and you told me I never did
The truth is you won't even be there when I can't stand on my own two feet
You won't be here
I saw right through you on my basement floor
But could you even see past my chest?
Could you ever feel past these hands?
Your intentions were only skin deep
Mine weren't honest enough to fall past my teeth
I've got this lonely night and Jimmy Eat World
I never had you and you told me I never did
The truth is you won't even be there when I can't stand on my own two feet
You won't be here
Will I ever know how it feels to be home again?
I've been told that home is where the heart is
If that's the case, I've never been home 
I've got this lonely night and Jimmy Eat World
I never had you and you told me I never did
The truth is you won't even be there when I can't stand on my own two feet
You won't be here
I've been up spending every late night in my car listening to all these sad songs
I know it sounds weird but they're helping me move past all these things running through my head
I'll blame the Midwest and sleepy eyes
I'm not where I should be
I'm not what I could be
But I'm not who I was
Nostalgia gets the best of me
When I wake up it's the same day
It fucks me up and makes me miss who I used to be
All I have are thoughts of me from back when I was eighteen and my bony knees
Don't want it to be like my teenage years
I was naive and weak back then without much trouble on my shoulders
If I don't break, I won't know how to put myself back together
Nostalgia gets the best of me
When I wake up it's the same day
It fucks me up and makes me miss who I used to be
All I have are thoughts of me from back when I was eighteen and my bony knees
If you never break, you'll never know how 
If you never break, you'll never know 
If you never break, you'll never know how to put yourself back together
Nostalgia gets the best of me
When I wake up it's the same day
It fucks me up and makes me miss who I used to be
All I have are thoughts of me from back when I was eighteen and my bony knees
Growing up is giving up
I'll sleep sideways on the bed in my moms basement 
It's where I feel at home
You'll sleep with regret and no heart left in your chest
I don't want to end up like you
Your eyes are set on what you'll never have
There's days I feel like a different person 
But I always come back to who I really am 
The American dream is dead, I'm still just a kid
Balancing on the sidewalks of this suburban town
Maybe this year I'll be able to stand up on my feet
Or maybe I'll fall again
I never want to grow out of this skin
That's been dragged through the dirt 
That's what made me find happiness 
My thumbs are broken but I'll take these broken thumbs 
Over your grip on an empty life
Your empty life
I've spent the end of my summer
Listening to these songs I know you don't like
I've been wondering where you are and who you're with
We used to lay on your kitchen floor at two a.m.
I was forty miles away from my house but I never felt so at home
I was forty miles away from my house 
You never called before you left to move west
I was just dead weight pulling you down
I'll move forward without the person I need
When somethings fallen apart as many times as us
I can't put it back together it's not the same
You still run through my head every night
When I lay in bed
You used to cover up the cigarette burn on the passenger seat
of my car
Now there's just empty coffee cups 
And long drives by myself
If you wore your personality on your skin, no one would take a second look
You were shallow when we met and you still are
The water won't be coming down anytime soon to change that
Loneliness keeps me warm at night and that's okay with me
I'd rather be alone in this bed made for two than listen to you and your judgement
Don't act like you're better than me
We're both fools lost in this cold world
You might not fall as much as I do, but if I look close enough I can find the scars on your knees
I can find the bags under your eyes that carry too much for you to handle
I'm starting to think that you're the reason why everyone left
So stop pointing your finger
You don't even really know me, not at all
You don't even really know me
Don't act like you're better than me
We're both fools lost in this cold world
You might not fall as much as I do, but if I look close enough I can find the scars on your knees
I can find the bags under your eyes that carry too much for you to handle
I said I'm selfish, I'm a liar and I'm broken
Shit runs through my head every day that I would never tell anyone
You're just like me
The only difference is that I'm honest enough to scream my flaws in the lines of this song
So much has changed back home since you left without packing all your things 
I always drive past your house hoping you'll be sitting on your porch
I still smell the smoke on your clothes 
And I can still hear those secondhand stories fall off your tongue
It's just not the same around here without you 
Most of the time I feel like you're in over your head out there 
You ran away from the Midwest and traded it in for beaches and east coast sunsets 
Don't take in too much too soon 
Keep your chin up out there 
Don't forget where you came from and who cares about you 
Whenever you're missing home, just look at your arm 
You've got the state lines inked into your forearm 
There's still memories of you pinned on my wall 
It's just not the same around here without you 
Most of the time I feel like you're in over your head out there 
You ran away from the Midwest and traded it in for beaches and east coast sunsets 
Don't take in too much too soon 
Maybe you'll be here next year to waste the fall away, watching the leaves blow across my driveway 
We could listen to American Football and talk about high school 
Just like we did the years before
Hope you're having fun away at college since you went there to run from all your fuck ups 
You're not so good at getting away from all of the karma that lies between your tongue and cheek 
It's gotten to the point that you're the spitting image of everything I never want to be 
I gave you chance after chance and it's obvious you haven't tried at all 
By now it's safe to say that I'll be erasing every trace you left in these lines 
I'm sorry for breaking down when I should've been stitching myself back up 
You left me on the fence with nowhere to jump since you always knew that my balance was as shitty as my judgment 
I had a feeling I'd be lying in the grass left for dead 
Now I'm stuck looking at that fence 
I gave you chance after chance and it's obvious you haven't tried at all 
By now it's safe to say that I'll be erasing every trace you left in these lines 
I'm sorry for breaking down when I should've been stitching myself back up
You've become the spitting image of everything I never want to be 
You're everything I never want to be
You'll spend every Saturday night on the bathroom floor with no recollection of the night before 
You're a train wreck and everything that's in between 
Being alone doesn't seem so bad to me 
You're the type of girl that lets this whole town know when your lips come anywhere near a bottle 
All you want is the attention from every eye and ear that covers up the walls in this room 
I'd rather sleep with just my bony knees and the thought of someone that stands up straight 
I guess I'll sleep alone tonight 
You'll tell everyone you're different, but you're just a shade of grey that never stuck out to anybody 
Fast forward to 2am and the walls aren't spinning around enough for you to forget your ex-boyfriend and all of your shitty friends 
You say you'll keep it together, but I know you're gonna make those walls fall down 
They always do 
I'd rather sleep with just my bony knees and the thought of someone that stands up straight 
I guess I'll sleep alone tonight 
You'll tell everyone you're different, but you're just a shade of grey that never stuck out to anybody 
I'd rather sleep with just my bony knees and the thought of someone that stands up straight 
I guess I'll sleep alone 
I'd rather sleep with just my bony knees and the thought of someone that stands up straight 
I guess I'll sleep alone tonight 
You'll tell everyone you're different, but you're just a shade of grey that never stuck out to anybody
I don't really think that I'm ready for another Chicago winter 
So you can stop making my bones feel cold 
I swear that emptiness lives inside your chest 
You're the reason you fell far away from what brought out your best 
Don't get me wrong, I wish a lot of things were the way they used to be 
The streets that used to make me feel alive just make me feel alone 
The holes in the wall get bigger every year 
It's hard to think that some people in this world look at me with the same eyes as yours 
I've been breaking all ten fingers for you and you wouldn't even lift one up for me 
Appreciation's something you lost in the dirt that's on your hands and knees 
But I'm never gonna be just a hole in the wall 
You can anchor down your feet and say fuck the past and everyone that dragged you here 
I'm not putting myself on a pedestal 
You need to stand up for yourself and who you claim you used to be 
It's hard to think that some people in this world look at me with the same eyes as yours 
I've been breaking all ten fingers for you and you wouldn't even lift one up for me 
Appreciation's something you lost in the dirt that's on your hands and knees 
Anchor down your feet, say fuck the past and everyone that dragged you here 
Just stand up for yourself and who you claim you used to be 
It's hard to think that some people in this world look at me with the same eyes as yours 
I've been breaking all ten fingers for you and you wouldn't even lift one up for me 
Appreciation's something you lost in the dirt that's on your hands and knees
You said I didn't cry out to the clouds for nothing 
You told me everything eventually works out 
That's what I'll keep telling myself 
I don't want to be jealous of the trees next to my neighbor's garage anymore 
I'll just lie in the mess I made 
Don't let me fall off the edge and break down 
Try not to forget everything I said 
Just another week and I'll pick myself up off my bony knees 
I guess it took a year to realize that what I had was everything I needed to feel okay 
But still I've got these sleepy eyes that have seen too much for me to handle 
I'm not gonna lie, my skin and bones have seen some better days 
Thirty pounds ago seems like a more stable place to stay 
I'm not gonna lie, my skin and bones have seen some better days 
I'm not gonna lie, my skin and bones have seen some better days 
Just another week and I'll pick myself up off my bony knees 
I guess it took a year to realize that what I had was everything I needed to feel okay 
But still I've got these sleepy eyes that have seen too much for me to handle 
There's no point to the floorboards in my house 
Nothing feels right 
I can't stand up without you 
Nothing feels right 
Just another week and I'll pick myself up off my bony knees 
I guess it took a year to realize that what I had was everything I needed to feel okay 
But still I've got these sleepy eyes that have seen too much for me to handle
We're just kids stuck in this town
Outside of a big city
Where everyone wants you to grow up as fast as they fall
My old friend Dave wakes up on Monday
Wishes there were more than two days in a weekend
I'll keep sleeping in on Monday not knowing
That my weekend is over
I'm just not ready to cut my hair and settle down
I'm not liking the thought of looking at myself
And seeing all the stress of my mother
And heavy eyes of my father
I don't have a lot of money
That's fine by me
I want to grow up in truck stops and on friends' floors
Maybe then I can feel my heart beat in rhythm with the real me
I wanted June to be in December since I felt summer on my shoulders
My old friend Dave wakes up on Monday
Wishes there were more than two days in a weekend
I'll keep sleeping in on Monday not knowing
That my weekend is over
I'm just not ready to cut my hair and settle down
I'm not liking the thought of looking at myself
And seeing all the stress of my mother
And heavy eyes of my father
We'll go run away
Waste all our time
We'll go run away
Waste all our time
We'll go run away
Waste all our time
We'll go run away
I'm just not ready to cut my hair and settle down
I'm not liking the thought of looking at myself
And seeing all the stress of my mother and heavy eyes
I'm just not ready to cut my hair and settle down
I'm not liking the thought of looking at myself
And seeing all the stress of my mother
And heavy eyes of my father
Now all my friends wake up on Monday
And wish that there were more than two days in a weekend
I'll keep sleeping in on Monday
Not knowing that my weekend is over
 

I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed

After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want
Knock me down
I'm not sure I have it in me to get back up
To be who I am seems exhausting anyway
You have a lot in common with my conscience
You both erase my confidence
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Back and forth
Between some kind of vague attachment to yesterday
And never knowing what form of myself I'll get today (to get today)
I'll always be a faded sign in your eyes
No matter what the point of view (point of view)
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
I'm not here
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want to hear
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Would you notice I'm not here
Am I telling myself the truth?
I'm used to pretending to be strong and clueless
Am I doing this right by you?
I seem to be coming off as wrong and ruthless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I changing my mind again?
All this indecision makes me shift my focus
Is the tension my only friend?
Anxiety holds my hand when life gets hopeless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I telling myself the truth about my self-esteem
And how others place their worth in me?
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
(The eyes of someone else)
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
Yeah, I'll keep smiling on the surface
(Am I telling myself the truth?)
"Smiling On The Surface" is the 3rd song released from the album "Composure". It was premiered on June 18, 2018.
Swallowing a feeling
Counting cracks across the ceiling
Never reached the depths of them before
Finding flaws in every format
I know but haven't shown that
I could pick myself up off the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Redefine rock bottom with these empty orange bottles
Never felt so paralysed before (never felt this paralysed)
We're all looking for some answers
With the hangman's broken lantern
Growing ever closer to the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Why do I, why do I, feel so damn cold?
Why am I, why am I, still so low?
Why should I, why should I, get up or get out?
Why should I?
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
Soft spoken, if ever out loud
These days not much gets out
My mind digs graves through the past
But never takes time to finish the act
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
No matter how cold it might get
My bed sheets are laced with regret
I try to fill in the lines
Rework the plans for a better design
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Here I am, bearing every burden
Here I am, showing every worry
To the world
To the world
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try
I'm at best your second option
Like a key under the mat
Are my emotions hard to read?
Seems I'm good at hiding
Reality
You disregard the consequences
Always seem to shift the blame
You burn the bridge and then I build it
Seems you're good at hiding
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
You make me feel helpless
Like a bird with broken wings
Forcing me to be more selfless
Lean on me, don't knock me over
It seems we're good at hiding
It seems we're good at fighting
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
I'm all alone
I feel sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
I'm all alone
I'm feeling sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
(There's nothing I can do)
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
Is there any chance you could cut me some slack?
Because I've been hanging for a while
From this withered rope
Forcing every sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
What could I ask that you help me hold back
Cause I've been falling for a while
Down this fucking slope
Losing any sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
There's a collage of photos framed
Dating '93 to '95
Though all it shows me is that
I'm just a bad seed
Falling off the family tree
I've got more complaints
More than pleasantries to say
Every monument is idly arranged
Every figure that has ever held importance in my life
I find nobody is who I pictured them to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the faces in reflections of the past
I feel so close but I can't reach through the glass
My life burns out and flickers like the end of a cigarette
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the light in your eyes
Turn the blind eye (Turn the blind eye)
"Why are you hurting me" she screamed from her death bed
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
It's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
The tears run down your cheekbones
I feel sorry for you
But I'm too fucking selfish to say I do
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be different
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Today I ripped myself wide open
And I saw that my heart isn't as fucked as I recalled
It's still flawed and
It's sorely stitched to my old ways
I thought it was buried, but it's just stuck
To my old ways
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be something else
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Shaking in the driver's seat
Staring at the dashboard
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
Please just stay
Please just stay
You see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
To take a chance on me
To take a chance
I still see us sitting on that old couch
'Til the sun comes up
Listening to sad songs
We spent our time with smiles on our faces
I know it sounds selfish but I'll miss those days
I know it sounds selfish
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
The Fall leaves flying through the driveway
Keep triggering these memories of you
I'm torn apart with how our lives are changing
I'm sure it sounds selfish, I'm just being honest
I know it sounds selfish
But I'm trying to be honest
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
Let's go back to when thing weren't complicated
Let's go back to all those old dashboard songs
Let's go back to smoking on the side of my old house
We can never go back, we'll never go back
We'll never go back
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
I know it sounds selfish
I'm just being honest
I can't fix everything around me
I can't make everybody happy
And it'll be okay
Show me how to be something other than nostalgic
I want to feel inspired and innocent again
I just want to be worth your time
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Lately when I'm alone I keep thinking about the past
I'm trying to feel weak in my knees again
I want to stand up straight like when I graduated
I just want to be
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Do you remember when you saw right through my selfish skin?
Do you remember when I ignored everything you did?
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
It'll be okay
We rush through our lives
Just to feel some kind of pride
Dismissing actualities is making matters worse
The ink will fade, but won't go away
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
I live in the middle of a lake
And I don't know how to swim
I've isolated everything
Everywhere I go I am consistently alone
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
Cautions only ever made me worry
You know that cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
The patience I once had is running away with my youth
Away in its hands
I've been neglecting who I am
That's just who I was back then
Don't need to be perfect, just happy
I'm still a lost boy
I'm still a lost boy
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
Every once in a while I listen to Death Cab and think about how it used to be 
We thought that we knew the answers
When no one was asking
Asking the questions 
I'm still a lost boy 
I'm still a lost boy 
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
It feels like I've been taking the long way for a while now
Haven't been at home in more years than I care to say
I keep letting my past cover what the present shouldn't be
What I shouldn't be
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
Staring out the window in my bedroom makes me think back
I see me as a boy out there
Lying in the grass
Singing songs with all the wrong notes
And graduating high school as my mom cries
I'm writing the same song over and over again
And feeling lost
I've always felt so lost
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I clenched the wheel the whole way home from Cleveland
With nothing more than my eyes half way open
And my hand smelling like smoke
Each mile I drive gets me closer to the streets that made me feel alone
I'm out of place and it doesn't feel wrong
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I care too much
While you don't even care at all
It's just sad that you don't even care
I walk up the stairs to your apartment and I feel small
The lowest feelings and even lower standards
Pictures of simple times are on the top shelf
You lie to me and say you're happy with the way things are
With the way things are
It's just sad, oh it's sad that you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I spent so much damn time trying to move forward
It hurts me to watch you falling backwards
Brave your life
Finding solutions, not making excuses
Find solutions and stop waiting for excuses
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I care too much, while you don't even care at all
A bit much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different
Don't settle because you're scared
You know I pictured things to be different
I pictured things to be different for you
For you
Could you stay here 'til I fall asleep?
We'll pretend that we could make each other feel complete
I'm looking for something that's not inside of you
Will you think of me when you drive home?
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
Last night I closed my eyes
And thought about someone that wasn't you
The weight of the world slipped off my shoulders
And weighed my back to the floor
It isn't where you want to be
I know this isn't where you want to be
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
You tell me I'm broken
As I stare out my window at the street lights
I walk outside and I sit in the shade at 3am
And I feel whole again
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
And I know we're disconnected
I'm getting pretty good at leaving, my patience isn't wearing thin
Autumn never ends in my head, no matter how far I've been
It feels like everybody is the branch and I'm the leaves
Falling from the top of every leafless tree
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
All I see is the past two years before I hit the ground
Time is moving slower on the way down (on the way down)
Save your time spent wondering what's going through my mind
Let me go before you see me following behind
I'll save you from myself
Just let me go
I'll save you from myself
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
I've learned that it's okay to be selfish
It keeps me from falling apart at the seams
Stuck is where I feel in place
A feeling I'll embrace
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
So much for bad luck
If I built a boat with apologies I've got
I'd have a sorry looking raft
It always rains
But it's nice to see
That someone else is sad
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
The coin's faced up
But I'm not feeling any better
A soap box made for every single fuck up
It's tough seeing where I am
Instead of where I'm from
My roots can get loose
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
Can you find your calling if nothing is calling for you?
I'm coughing up a lung trying to get rid of you
To get rid of you
To get rid of you
Can you find your calling
If nothing's calling for you?
For you?
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
When I heard my parents cry
I realized that we're all lost kids
Trying to find our way home
Blood is thicker than water
And I still feel like everyone I love forgot how to swim
At least there are pictures of my sister and me
Hanging on the wall in my garage
They always give me peace of mind
They always give me peace of mind
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I'm starting to see that
We're always changing
It's just so weird to think that we're always changing
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
I never spent my youth thinking of half the shit I'd go through
Living in the past never helped me
Last night I drove past the house that I grew up in
And tried to find that happiness
Living in the past never helped me
Or anyone move forward
There's no love, no growth for me here
Anymore, anymore
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I know this place is the same and that I'm changing
And I'm just
When I get stopped by a train on my drive home
I don't let it get to me like the rest of the world
I smile and think about how much I've grown over this year
It gives me time to open my mind and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that train
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine without you
I've laid to rest the shit that was always out of my hands
I finally sent all my skeletons away
Like everything I couldn't fix and people I couldn't change
Konstantine always tore me apart and made me cry
Now I hear that song and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that...
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine
Happiness, won't get me over this
Happiness, won't get me over anything, over anything 
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I spend my nights thinking the worst
And telling myself that everything's going to work out
I keep kicking myself in the mouth
Opening up every cut that should be a scar by now
I need the hope I always tell my friends about
I need the hope I always tell my friends about
I sleep with the TV on, it covers up my feelings about the past
Here I am lying awake thinking about how things used to be
I'm sick and tired
I'm sick and tired of being at the same old place in my head
Give me peace of mind
I always backtrack to my old self
When I'm holding on to despair and cracks in my life
I'm holding on when I need to let go
I sleep with the TV on, it covers up my feelings about the past
Here I am lying awake thinking about how things used to be
Doubt is the soil that fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
Doubt is the soil that fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
Doubt is the story of how fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
I'm dirty from head to toe
I'm dirty from head to toe
Change holds me down to the places I don't want to be
When I wake up I look in the mirror and I see
The person that's been scaring me away from moving on
And getting out of my head
I end my nights in the same spot that I told myself I would leave
I want to come home and have it be like it was before I left
I'm starting to see that I keep living alone in the past
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
I can't shake it off
Always a fight between my past,
My head, and my heart, you can cut me up
And spread me all over Illinois
I can't, I can't find myself
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
I'm stuck and I feel like I'm the only one
I end my nights in the same spot that I told myself I would leave
I want to come home and have it be like it was before I left
I'm starting to see that I keep living alone in the past
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
Did I get left behind?
Or is everybody else just hiding that they're lost
Loneliness will never leave my mind
Loneliness will never leave my mind
Did I get left behind?
Or is everybody else just hiding that they're lost
Just when I think I need someone, 
They wrap their arms around my old bones 
And I start breaking apart
I walk away from anyone that cares about me
But I swear my skin's not as rough as I make it out to be
The saddest part is I've been distant since I was sixteen
It keeps me up in bed
I'm stuck here with all the choices I've made 
And the chances I was too afraid to take
I've called myself young and stupid, 
But lately I feel old and desperate
I find it kind of weird how you find yourself 
When you have no one
I look for the right things in all the wrong places
The saddest part is I've been distant since I was sixteen
It keeps me up in bed
I'm stuck here with all the choices I've made 
And the chances I was too afraid to take
I found myself in a late night drives
Without a destination
All I had were thoughts about the past
And a list of my favorite songs to keep me company
But I still struggle and lose myself everyday
I always find myself lost in every line of all these songs
But I felt better when I saw that this is life
And in life were gonna cry
In life were gonna lose sleep
Were gonna feel helpless
But thats how its got to be 
When you lose yourself you'll find what you're looking for
I'm growing past who I used to be
As the night goes on 
I go from feeling out of place to feeling like a ghost
You miss me when I'm gone
But when I'm around it's like I'm hidden behind the paint on the walls
The loneliness will keep me warm tonight
It'll keep me warm seeing as you won't
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more than this
If the open road is my home I'm never leaving
All of the small towns make me throw away my biggest fears
And the big cities make the fucked up stuff feel smaller
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more than this
When I'm not here does anyone miss my secondhand smoke?
Do you wonder where I am or who I'm with?
Call me a mid-twenty sob story
I can't change the way I feel
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more,
Looking for something more
You were easy on my eyes
You were heavy on my heart
I never thought I'd live to see today
You're still in my mind
But not in my chest
I'm a little worn out since you fucking tore me down
You made me believe we had something
I guess that I was wrong
I thought I would be numb to this by now
I guess I was wrong
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
Stick with me or don't stick around at all
I was the boy who was too scared and ran away
I was the glue that never dried
You were the girl that made up her mind
And left me all alone to die
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
I'll sit on my basement floor
Turn off all the lights and try to not think about you
Just know that when I'm down there
I'll know that I won't be running through your mind
You were easy on my eyes
You were heavy on my heart
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
And I'll get through the winter without you
You made me believe we had something
Well I guess that I was wrong
I'm treated like an old book
That was left on the shelf
Everyone underlined what they wanted to read
And forgot the rest
My spine was left worn out and bent
So just take what you want from me
And forget the rest
It really weirds me out 
Because I never thought I'd be where I am today
My bones want to tear out of my skin
This isn't where I want to be
Getting older scares the shit out of me
I'm an old book
It's one of those nights where I'm scared to walk to my basement
These four walls, feel like they're caving in
There's pictures of you and me hidden behind my couch
I'll be waiting for the sun to shine through my window well
Am I trying to forget you or just cover you up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
I used to have an escape
But I ripped the map up a long time ago
So I'll lie to myself and say that I don't care at all
You'll always be hidden in the basement of everything I love
Am I trying to forget you or just cover you up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
The only time that I feel fine
Is when I'm parked in front of my house with tears in my eyes
I find comfort in weakness because it's always there for me
You'll always be hidden in the basement
Of everything I love
Are you trying to forget me or did you cover me up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
I can't believe you've got the nerve to say you love me
Then you left me for dead
I don't love you anymore
I hope you're happy since I don't know you anymore
You were a part of me 
And now you're just nothing but a memory
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
Now I'm just like the pictures that you take
I'm nothing but something that once was
Like colors that fade away in the sunlight
They're nothing special like they used to be
They're gone and they're never coming back
No, they're never coming back
I'm gone and I'm never coming back
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
I woke up today and realized that what we had is dead
I'm just a pile of lifeless bones to you
I've spent too many years thinking about somebody 
That doesn't even think about me
Thinking about somebody that doesn't even think about me
Thinking about somebody That doesn't even think about... 
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
Maybe this place is the same...
And we're just changing
Maybe this place is the same...
And we're just changing
I'm driving on state lines pretending you're standing there
But I know your feet will never be where my eyes fall again
Moving on is something I've always had trouble with
But this year I swear I'll get past it
If I had a backyard I would bury all my memories of you in it
Everything that we had would die right down in the dirt
I wish I had the guts to say this to your face
But the past five years took everything I had and ripped it out of me
You used to make me feel like I was something
Now you make me feel like absolutely nothing
I want to fall asleep and wake up four years ago
We were just kids who didn't know what love was
Or what we were digging ourselves into
I want to know if you ever hear 
All of these sad fucking songs I write about you
I wish I had the guts to say this to your face
But the past five years took everything I had and ripped it out of me
You used to make me feel like I was something
Now you make me feel like absolutely nothing
I know you probably hate who I've become
I'm just young and stupid, 
But that's the way I always want to be
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone 
You wouldn't know a good thing even if it slapped the makeup right off of your face
Burn down the bridges just in time for last call
Keep digging yourself neck deep into selfishness
I doubt that you'll ever find out who you really are
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone
Keep falling over that same fucking step on your front porch
Most people learn from their mistakes
But you'll just stay here tripping on the same mistakes
You always do
No one's knocked you off your feet, they say what you want to hear
You're living proof that we don't always get what we deserve
But you're really nothing special
Just another crack in the sidewalk
You never meant anything to me
Or anyone for more than one night
No one's gonna stick around for when you're broken down and blacked out
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone
Keep falling over that same fucking step on your front porch
Most people learn from their mistakes
But you'll just stay here tripping on the same mistakes
You always do
Throw away your early twenties giving up on everyone and everything around you
It never came so easy
Throw away your early twenties giving up on everyone and everything around you
It never came so easy
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone
Keep falling over that same fucking step on your front porch
Most people learn from their mistakes
But you'll just stay here tripping on the same mistakes
You always do
You used to make me feel like I could walk on water
Now most nights I'm just sinking down and down
You're the reason why I can't listen to the same songs I used to
I write songs about you all the time
I bet I don't run through your mind
I've given up on you, but it still hurts to know you're not alone
Don't worry, I'll keep out of your life and stay awake at night
It's 4am and you're keeping me from closing these sleepy eyes
Does the thought of me keep you up at night?
Like the light on the ceiling of your bedroom
Lately, my dog's the only one around that listens to my problems
It's been a lonely year 
I write songs about you all the time
I bet I don't run through your mind
I've given up on you, but it still hurts to know you're not alone
Don't worry, I'll keep out of your life and stay awake at night
With just my skin and bones
It hurts to know you're not alone
I've given up on you, and my skin, and my bones
Spit in my face, tell me I didn't mean what I said
I'll take those words with me when I'm dead
Open your mouth and contradict everything you said last summer
I don't even know you anymore, anymore
You really fucked me up this time for good, even though you didn't mean to
When the weather clears, that sweatshirt weather won't keep you warm like I do
You'll be thinking of my sleepy eyes and bony knees
You'll be thinking of me
Maybe I'll run away from home, fake my own death and see if you really care
A week goes by, I doubt you'll be waiting around for me at all
No matter how many times I walk up my driveway, you won't be there
You're nowhere to be found because everything you said was a lie
You really fucked me up this time for good, even though you didn't mean to
When the weather clears, that sweatshirt weather won't keep you warm like I do
You'll be thinking of my sleepy eyes and bony knees
You'll be thinking of me
You wanted me when I was running away
I needed you when I ripped your heart out
I can't count the times we fell apart
We can't go back, it's not the same
You really fucked me up this time for good, even though you didn't mean to
When the weather clears, that sweatshirt weather won't keep you warm like I do
You'll be thinking of my sleepy eyes and bony knees
You'll be thinking of me
When something's fallen apart as many times as us
I can't put it back together, it's not the same
This time around I wasn't honest enough with how I really felt
I'll spend the winter blending into the streets and sidewalks that make up this town
At least it gave me someone else to write another one of these sad fucking songs about
You're just another sad song to me
I've got this lonely night and Jimmy Eat World
I never had you and you told me I never did
The truth is you won't even be there when I can't stand on my own two feet
You won't be here
I saw right through you on my basement floor
But could you even see past my chest?
Could you ever feel past these hands?
Your intentions were only skin deep
Mine weren't honest enough to fall past my teeth
I've got this lonely night and Jimmy Eat World
I never had you and you told me I never did
The truth is you won't even be there when I can't stand on my own two feet
You won't be here
Will I ever know how it feels to be home again?
I've been told that home is where the heart is
If that's the case, I've never been home 
I've got this lonely night and Jimmy Eat World
I never had you and you told me I never did
The truth is you won't even be there when I can't stand on my own two feet
You won't be here
I've been up spending every late night in my car listening to all these sad songs
I know it sounds weird but they're helping me move past all these things running through my head
I'll blame the Midwest and sleepy eyes
I'm not where I should be
I'm not what I could be
But I'm not who I was
Nostalgia gets the best of me
When I wake up it's the same day
It fucks me up and makes me miss who I used to be
All I have are thoughts of me from back when I was eighteen and my bony knees
Don't want it to be like my teenage years
I was naive and weak back then without much trouble on my shoulders
If I don't break, I won't know how to put myself back together
Nostalgia gets the best of me
When I wake up it's the same day
It fucks me up and makes me miss who I used to be
All I have are thoughts of me from back when I was eighteen and my bony knees
If you never break, you'll never know how 
If you never break, you'll never know 
If you never break, you'll never know how to put yourself back together
Nostalgia gets the best of me
When I wake up it's the same day
It fucks me up and makes me miss who I used to be
All I have are thoughts of me from back when I was eighteen and my bony knees
Growing up is giving up
I'll sleep sideways on the bed in my moms basement 
It's where I feel at home
You'll sleep with regret and no heart left in your chest
I don't want to end up like you
Your eyes are set on what you'll never have
There's days I feel like a different person 
But I always come back to who I really am 
The American dream is dead, I'm still just a kid
Balancing on the sidewalks of this suburban town
Maybe this year I'll be able to stand up on my feet
Or maybe I'll fall again
I never want to grow out of this skin
That's been dragged through the dirt 
That's what made me find happiness 
My thumbs are broken but I'll take these broken thumbs 
Over your grip on an empty life
Your empty life
I've spent the end of my summer
Listening to these songs I know you don't like
I've been wondering where you are and who you're with
We used to lay on your kitchen floor at two a.m.
I was forty miles away from my house but I never felt so at home
I was forty miles away from my house 
You never called before you left to move west
I was just dead weight pulling you down
I'll move forward without the person I need
When somethings fallen apart as many times as us
I can't put it back together it's not the same
You still run through my head every night
When I lay in bed
You used to cover up the cigarette burn on the passenger seat
of my car
Now there's just empty coffee cups 
And long drives by myself
If you wore your personality on your skin, no one would take a second look
You were shallow when we met and you still are
The water won't be coming down anytime soon to change that
Loneliness keeps me warm at night and that's okay with me
I'd rather be alone in this bed made for two than listen to you and your judgement
Don't act like you're better than me
We're both fools lost in this cold world
You might not fall as much as I do, but if I look close enough I can find the scars on your knees
I can find the bags under your eyes that carry too much for you to handle
I'm starting to think that you're the reason why everyone left
So stop pointing your finger
You don't even really know me, not at all
You don't even really know me
Don't act like you're better than me
We're both fools lost in this cold world
You might not fall as much as I do, but if I look close enough I can find the scars on your knees
I can find the bags under your eyes that carry too much for you to handle
I said I'm selfish, I'm a liar and I'm broken
Shit runs through my head every day that I would never tell anyone
You're just like me
The only difference is that I'm honest enough to scream my flaws in the lines of this song
So much has changed back home since you left without packing all your things 
I always drive past your house hoping you'll be sitting on your porch
I still smell the smoke on your clothes 
And I can still hear those secondhand stories fall off your tongue
It's just not the same around here without you 
Most of the time I feel like you're in over your head out there 
You ran away from the Midwest and traded it in for beaches and east coast sunsets 
Don't take in too much too soon 
Keep your chin up out there 
Don't forget where you came from and who cares about you 
Whenever you're missing home, just look at your arm 
You've got the state lines inked into your forearm 
There's still memories of you pinned on my wall 
It's just not the same around here without you 
Most of the time I feel like you're in over your head out there 
You ran away from the Midwest and traded it in for beaches and east coast sunsets 
Don't take in too much too soon 
Maybe you'll be here next year to waste the fall away, watching the leaves blow across my driveway 
We could listen to American Football and talk about high school 
Just like we did the years before
Hope you're having fun away at college since you went there to run from all your fuck ups 
You're not so good at getting away from all of the karma that lies between your tongue and cheek 
It's gotten to the point that you're the spitting image of everything I never want to be 
I gave you chance after chance and it's obvious you haven't tried at all 
By now it's safe to say that I'll be erasing every trace you left in these lines 
I'm sorry for breaking down when I should've been stitching myself back up 
You left me on the fence with nowhere to jump since you always knew that my balance was as shitty as my judgment 
I had a feeling I'd be lying in the grass left for dead 
Now I'm stuck looking at that fence 
I gave you chance after chance and it's obvious you haven't tried at all 
By now it's safe to say that I'll be erasing every trace you left in these lines 
I'm sorry for breaking down when I should've been stitching myself back up
You've become the spitting image of everything I never want to be 
You're everything I never want to be
You'll spend every Saturday night on the bathroom floor with no recollection of the night before 
You're a train wreck and everything that's in between 
Being alone doesn't seem so bad to me 
You're the type of girl that lets this whole town know when your lips come anywhere near a bottle 
All you want is the attention from every eye and ear that covers up the walls in this room 
I'd rather sleep with just my bony knees and the thought of someone that stands up straight 
I guess I'll sleep alone tonight 
You'll tell everyone you're different, but you're just a shade of grey that never stuck out to anybody 
Fast forward to 2am and the walls aren't spinning around enough for you to forget your ex-boyfriend and all of your shitty friends 
You say you'll keep it together, but I know you're gonna make those walls fall down 
They always do 
I'd rather sleep with just my bony knees and the thought of someone that stands up straight 
I guess I'll sleep alone tonight 
You'll tell everyone you're different, but you're just a shade of grey that never stuck out to anybody 
I'd rather sleep with just my bony knees and the thought of someone that stands up straight 
I guess I'll sleep alone 
I'd rather sleep with just my bony knees and the thought of someone that stands up straight 
I guess I'll sleep alone tonight 
You'll tell everyone you're different, but you're just a shade of grey that never stuck out to anybody
I don't really think that I'm ready for another Chicago winter 
So you can stop making my bones feel cold 
I swear that emptiness lives inside your chest 
You're the reason you fell far away from what brought out your best 
Don't get me wrong, I wish a lot of things were the way they used to be 
The streets that used to make me feel alive just make me feel alone 
The holes in the wall get bigger every year 
It's hard to think that some people in this world look at me with the same eyes as yours 
I've been breaking all ten fingers for you and you wouldn't even lift one up for me 
Appreciation's something you lost in the dirt that's on your hands and knees 
But I'm never gonna be just a hole in the wall 
You can anchor down your feet and say fuck the past and everyone that dragged you here 
I'm not putting myself on a pedestal 
You need to stand up for yourself and who you claim you used to be 
It's hard to think that some people in this world look at me with the same eyes as yours 
I've been breaking all ten fingers for you and you wouldn't even lift one up for me 
Appreciation's something you lost in the dirt that's on your hands and knees 
Anchor down your feet, say fuck the past and everyone that dragged you here 
Just stand up for yourself and who you claim you used to be 
It's hard to think that some people in this world look at me with the same eyes as yours 
I've been breaking all ten fingers for you and you wouldn't even lift one up for me 
Appreciation's something you lost in the dirt that's on your hands and knees
You said I didn't cry out to the clouds for nothing 
You told me everything eventually works out 
That's what I'll keep telling myself 
I don't want to be jealous of the trees next to my neighbor's garage anymore 
I'll just lie in the mess I made 
Don't let me fall off the edge and break down 
Try not to forget everything I said 
Just another week and I'll pick myself up off my bony knees 
I guess it took a year to realize that what I had was everything I needed to feel okay 
But still I've got these sleepy eyes that have seen too much for me to handle 
I'm not gonna lie, my skin and bones have seen some better days 
Thirty pounds ago seems like a more stable place to stay 
I'm not gonna lie, my skin and bones have seen some better days 
I'm not gonna lie, my skin and bones have seen some better days 
Just another week and I'll pick myself up off my bony knees 
I guess it took a year to realize that what I had was everything I needed to feel okay 
But still I've got these sleepy eyes that have seen too much for me to handle 
There's no point to the floorboards in my house 
Nothing feels right 
I can't stand up without you 
Nothing feels right 
Just another week and I'll pick myself up off my bony knees 
I guess it took a year to realize that what I had was everything I needed to feel okay 
But still I've got these sleepy eyes that have seen too much for me to handle
We're just kids stuck in this town
Outside of a big city
Where everyone wants you to grow up as fast as they fall
My old friend Dave wakes up on Monday
Wishes there were more than two days in a weekend
I'll keep sleeping in on Monday not knowing
That my weekend is over
I'm just not ready to cut my hair and settle down
I'm not liking the thought of looking at myself
And seeing all the stress of my mother
And heavy eyes of my father
I don't have a lot of money
That's fine by me
I want to grow up in truck stops and on friends' floors
Maybe then I can feel my heart beat in rhythm with the real me
I wanted June to be in December since I felt summer on my shoulders
My old friend Dave wakes up on Monday
Wishes there were more than two days in a weekend
I'll keep sleeping in on Monday not knowing
That my weekend is over
I'm just not ready to cut my hair and settle down
I'm not liking the thought of looking at myself
And seeing all the stress of my mother
And heavy eyes of my father
We'll go run away
Waste all our time
We'll go run away
Waste all our time
We'll go run away
Waste all our time
We'll go run away
I'm just not ready to cut my hair and settle down
I'm not liking the thought of looking at myself
And seeing all the stress of my mother and heavy eyes
I'm just not ready to cut my hair and settle down
I'm not liking the thought of looking at myself
And seeing all the stress of my mother
And heavy eyes of my father
Now all my friends wake up on Monday
And wish that there were more than two days in a weekend
I'll keep sleeping in on Monday
Not knowing that my weekend is over
I won't forget when I couldn't go to bed with the lights off
When I heard that voice call me in for the night
I remember when love was just a word and not a fight
All I had to worry about were broken bones and being left alone
Way back then there were monsters in my closet
And now there's just skeletons hiding in there
The clock is ticking away
The leaves are still falling every day
The sunburn on my shoulders kept me warm back then
Like the heat from the blacktop again and again
I remember when smoke didn't fill my lungs
When my hands were lost and so young
It seemed like the houses were touching the sky
And I thought this smile on my face would never lie
Oh, the summer we were staring at the sun
The summer we were staring at the
Oh, the summer we were staring at the sun
Way back then there were monsters in my closet
And now there's just skeletons hiding in there
The clock is ticking away
The leaves are still falling every day
The sunburn on my shoulders kept me warm back then
Like the heat from the blacktop again and again
 

I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out

But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed

I'm not sure I have it in me to get back up
To be who I am seems exhausting anyway
You have a lot in common with my conscience
You both erase my confidence
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Back and forth
Between some kind of vague attachment to yesterday
And never knowing what form of myself I'll get today (to get today)
I'll always be a faded sign in your eyes
No matter what the point of view (point of view)
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
I'm not here
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want to hear
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Would you notice I'm not here
Am I telling myself the truth?
I'm used to pretending to be strong and clueless
Am I doing this right by you?
I seem to be coming off as wrong and ruthless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I changing my mind again?
All this indecision makes me shift my focus
Is the tension my only friend?
Anxiety holds my hand when life gets hopeless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I telling myself the truth about my self-esteem
And how others place their worth in me?
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
(The eyes of someone else)
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
Yeah, I'll keep smiling on the surface
(Am I telling myself the truth?)
"Smiling On The Surface" is the 3rd song released from the album "Composure". It was premiered on June 18, 2018.
Swallowing a feeling
Counting cracks across the ceiling
Never reached the depths of them before
Finding flaws in every format
I know but haven't shown that
I could pick myself up off the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Redefine rock bottom with these empty orange bottles
Never felt so paralysed before (never felt this paralysed)
We're all looking for some answers
With the hangman's broken lantern
Growing ever closer to the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Why do I, why do I, feel so damn cold?
Why am I, why am I, still so low?
Why should I, why should I, get up or get out?
Why should I?
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
Soft spoken, if ever out loud
These days not much gets out
My mind digs graves through the past
But never takes time to finish the act
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
No matter how cold it might get
My bed sheets are laced with regret
I try to fill in the lines
Rework the plans for a better design
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Here I am, bearing every burden
Here I am, showing every worry
To the world
To the world
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try
I'm at best your second option
Like a key under the mat
Are my emotions hard to read?
Seems I'm good at hiding
Reality
You disregard the consequences
Always seem to shift the blame
You burn the bridge and then I build it
Seems you're good at hiding
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
You make me feel helpless
Like a bird with broken wings
Forcing me to be more selfless
Lean on me, don't knock me over
It seems we're good at hiding
It seems we're good at fighting
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
I'm all alone
I feel sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
I'm all alone
I'm feeling sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
(There's nothing I can do)
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
Is there any chance you could cut me some slack?
Because I've been hanging for a while
From this withered rope
Forcing every sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
What could I ask that you help me hold back
Cause I've been falling for a while
Down this fucking slope
Losing any sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
There's a collage of photos framed
Dating '93 to '95
Though all it shows me is that
I'm just a bad seed
Falling off the family tree
I've got more complaints
More than pleasantries to say
Every monument is idly arranged
Every figure that has ever held importance in my life
I find nobody is who I pictured them to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the faces in reflections of the past
I feel so close but I can't reach through the glass
My life burns out and flickers like the end of a cigarette
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the light in your eyes
Turn the blind eye (Turn the blind eye)
"Why are you hurting me" she screamed from her death bed
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
It's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
The tears run down your cheekbones
I feel sorry for you
But I'm too fucking selfish to say I do
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be different
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Today I ripped myself wide open
And I saw that my heart isn't as fucked as I recalled
It's still flawed and
It's sorely stitched to my old ways
I thought it was buried, but it's just stuck
To my old ways
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be something else
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Shaking in the driver's seat
Staring at the dashboard
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
Please just stay
Please just stay
You see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
To take a chance on me
To take a chance
I still see us sitting on that old couch
'Til the sun comes up
Listening to sad songs
We spent our time with smiles on our faces
I know it sounds selfish but I'll miss those days
I know it sounds selfish
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
The Fall leaves flying through the driveway
Keep triggering these memories of you
I'm torn apart with how our lives are changing
I'm sure it sounds selfish, I'm just being honest
I know it sounds selfish
But I'm trying to be honest
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
Let's go back to when thing weren't complicated
Let's go back to all those old dashboard songs
Let's go back to smoking on the side of my old house
We can never go back, we'll never go back
We'll never go back
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
I know it sounds selfish
I'm just being honest
I can't fix everything around me
I can't make everybody happy
And it'll be okay
Show me how to be something other than nostalgic
I want to feel inspired and innocent again
I just want to be worth your time
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Lately when I'm alone I keep thinking about the past
I'm trying to feel weak in my knees again
I want to stand up straight like when I graduated
I just want to be
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Do you remember when you saw right through my selfish skin?
Do you remember when I ignored everything you did?
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
It'll be okay
We rush through our lives
Just to feel some kind of pride
Dismissing actualities is making matters worse
The ink will fade, but won't go away
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
I live in the middle of a lake
And I don't know how to swim
I've isolated everything
Everywhere I go I am consistently alone
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
Cautions only ever made me worry
You know that cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
The patience I once had is running away with my youth
Away in its hands
I've been neglecting who I am
That's just who I was back then
Don't need to be perfect, just happy
I'm still a lost boy
I'm still a lost boy
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
Every once in a while I listen to Death Cab and think about how it used to be 
We thought that we knew the answers
When no one was asking
Asking the questions 
I'm still a lost boy 
I'm still a lost boy 
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
It feels like I've been taking the long way for a while now
Haven't been at home in more years than I care to say
I keep letting my past cover what the present shouldn't be
What I shouldn't be
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
Staring out the window in my bedroom makes me think back
I see me as a boy out there
Lying in the grass
Singing songs with all the wrong notes
And graduating high school as my mom cries
I'm writing the same song over and over again
And feeling lost
I've always felt so lost
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I clenched the wheel the whole way home from Cleveland
With nothing more than my eyes half way open
And my hand smelling like smoke
Each mile I drive gets me closer to the streets that made me feel alone
I'm out of place and it doesn't feel wrong
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I care too much
While you don't even care at all
It's just sad that you don't even care
I walk up the stairs to your apartment and I feel small
The lowest feelings and even lower standards
Pictures of simple times are on the top shelf
You lie to me and say you're happy with the way things are
With the way things are
It's just sad, oh it's sad that you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I spent so much damn time trying to move forward
It hurts me to watch you falling backwards
Brave your life
Finding solutions, not making excuses
Find solutions and stop waiting for excuses
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I care too much, while you don't even care at all
A bit much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different
Don't settle because you're scared
You know I pictured things to be different
I pictured things to be different for you
For you
Could you stay here 'til I fall asleep?
We'll pretend that we could make each other feel complete
I'm looking for something that's not inside of you
Will you think of me when you drive home?
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
Last night I closed my eyes
And thought about someone that wasn't you
The weight of the world slipped off my shoulders
And weighed my back to the floor
It isn't where you want to be
I know this isn't where you want to be
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
You tell me I'm broken
As I stare out my window at the street lights
I walk outside and I sit in the shade at 3am
And I feel whole again
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
And I know we're disconnected
I'm getting pretty good at leaving, my patience isn't wearing thin
Autumn never ends in my head, no matter how far I've been
It feels like everybody is the branch and I'm the leaves
Falling from the top of every leafless tree
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
All I see is the past two years before I hit the ground
Time is moving slower on the way down (on the way down)
Save your time spent wondering what's going through my mind
Let me go before you see me following behind
I'll save you from myself
Just let me go
I'll save you from myself
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
I've learned that it's okay to be selfish
It keeps me from falling apart at the seams
Stuck is where I feel in place
A feeling I'll embrace
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
So much for bad luck
If I built a boat with apologies I've got
I'd have a sorry looking raft
It always rains
But it's nice to see
That someone else is sad
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
The coin's faced up
But I'm not feeling any better
A soap box made for every single fuck up
It's tough seeing where I am
Instead of where I'm from
My roots can get loose
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
Can you find your calling if nothing is calling for you?
I'm coughing up a lung trying to get rid of you
To get rid of you
To get rid of you
Can you find your calling
If nothing's calling for you?
For you?
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
When I heard my parents cry
I realized that we're all lost kids
Trying to find our way home
Blood is thicker than water
And I still feel like everyone I love forgot how to swim
At least there are pictures of my sister and me
Hanging on the wall in my garage
They always give me peace of mind
They always give me peace of mind
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I'm starting to see that
We're always changing
It's just so weird to think that we're always changing
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
I never spent my youth thinking of half the shit I'd go through
Living in the past never helped me
Last night I drove past the house that I grew up in
And tried to find that happiness
Living in the past never helped me
Or anyone move forward
There's no love, no growth for me here
Anymore, anymore
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I know this place is the same and that I'm changing
And I'm just
When I get stopped by a train on my drive home
I don't let it get to me like the rest of the world
I smile and think about how much I've grown over this year
It gives me time to open my mind and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that train
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine without you
I've laid to rest the shit that was always out of my hands
I finally sent all my skeletons away
Like everything I couldn't fix and people I couldn't change
Konstantine always tore me apart and made me cry
Now I hear that song and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that...
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine
Happiness, won't get me over this
Happiness, won't get me over anything, over anything 
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I spend my nights thinking the worst
And telling myself that everything's going to work out
I keep kicking myself in the mouth
Opening up every cut that should be a scar by now
I need the hope I always tell my friends about
I need the hope I always tell my friends about
I sleep with the TV on, it covers up my feelings about the past
Here I am lying awake thinking about how things used to be
I'm sick and tired
I'm sick and tired of being at the same old place in my head
Give me peace of mind
I always backtrack to my old self
When I'm holding on to despair and cracks in my life
I'm holding on when I need to let go
I sleep with the TV on, it covers up my feelings about the past
Here I am lying awake thinking about how things used to be
Doubt is the soil that fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
Doubt is the soil that fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
Doubt is the story of how fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
I'm dirty from head to toe
I'm dirty from head to toe
Change holds me down to the places I don't want to be
When I wake up I look in the mirror and I see
The person that's been scaring me away from moving on
And getting out of my head
I end my nights in the same spot that I told myself I would leave
I want to come home and have it be like it was before I left
I'm starting to see that I keep living alone in the past
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
I can't shake it off
Always a fight between my past,
My head, and my heart, you can cut me up
And spread me all over Illinois
I can't, I can't find myself
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
I'm stuck and I feel like I'm the only one
I end my nights in the same spot that I told myself I would leave
I want to come home and have it be like it was before I left
I'm starting to see that I keep living alone in the past
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
Did I get left behind?
Or is everybody else just hiding that they're lost
Loneliness will never leave my mind
Loneliness will never leave my mind
Did I get left behind?
Or is everybody else just hiding that they're lost
Just when I think I need someone, 
They wrap their arms around my old bones 
And I start breaking apart
I walk away from anyone that cares about me
But I swear my skin's not as rough as I make it out to be
The saddest part is I've been distant since I was sixteen
It keeps me up in bed
I'm stuck here with all the choices I've made 
And the chances I was too afraid to take
I've called myself young and stupid, 
But lately I feel old and desperate
I find it kind of weird how you find yourself 
When you have no one
I look for the right things in all the wrong places
The saddest part is I've been distant since I was sixteen
It keeps me up in bed
I'm stuck here with all the choices I've made 
And the chances I was too afraid to take
I found myself in a late night drives
Without a destination
All I had were thoughts about the past
And a list of my favorite songs to keep me company
But I still struggle and lose myself everyday
I always find myself lost in every line of all these songs
But I felt better when I saw that this is life
And in life were gonna cry
In life were gonna lose sleep
Were gonna feel helpless
But thats how its got to be 
When you lose yourself you'll find what you're looking for
I'm growing past who I used to be
As the night goes on 
I go from feeling out of place to feeling like a ghost
You miss me when I'm gone
But when I'm around it's like I'm hidden behind the paint on the walls
The loneliness will keep me warm tonight
It'll keep me warm seeing as you won't
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more than this
If the open road is my home I'm never leaving
All of the small towns make me throw away my biggest fears
And the big cities make the fucked up stuff feel smaller
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more than this
When I'm not here does anyone miss my secondhand smoke?
Do you wonder where I am or who I'm with?
Call me a mid-twenty sob story
I can't change the way I feel
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more,
Looking for something more
You were easy on my eyes
You were heavy on my heart
I never thought I'd live to see today
You're still in my mind
But not in my chest
I'm a little worn out since you fucking tore me down
You made me believe we had something
I guess that I was wrong
I thought I would be numb to this by now
I guess I was wrong
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
Stick with me or don't stick around at all
I was the boy who was too scared and ran away
I was the glue that never dried
You were the girl that made up her mind
And left me all alone to die
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
I'll sit on my basement floor
Turn off all the lights and try to not think about you
Just know that when I'm down there
I'll know that I won't be running through your mind
You were easy on my eyes
You were heavy on my heart
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
And I'll get through the winter without you
You made me believe we had something
Well I guess that I was wrong
I'm treated like an old book
That was left on the shelf
Everyone underlined what they wanted to read
And forgot the rest
My spine was left worn out and bent
So just take what you want from me
And forget the rest
It really weirds me out 
Because I never thought I'd be where I am today
My bones want to tear out of my skin
This isn't where I want to be
Getting older scares the shit out of me
I'm an old book
It's one of those nights where I'm scared to walk to my basement
These four walls, feel like they're caving in
There's pictures of you and me hidden behind my couch
I'll be waiting for the sun to shine through my window well
Am I trying to forget you or just cover you up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
I used to have an escape
But I ripped the map up a long time ago
So I'll lie to myself and say that I don't care at all
You'll always be hidden in the basement of everything I love
Am I trying to forget you or just cover you up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
The only time that I feel fine
Is when I'm parked in front of my house with tears in my eyes
I find comfort in weakness because it's always there for me
You'll always be hidden in the basement
Of everything I love
Are you trying to forget me or did you cover me up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
I can't believe you've got the nerve to say you love me
Then you left me for dead
I don't love you anymore
I hope you're happy since I don't know you anymore
You were a part of me 
And now you're just nothing but a memory
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
Now I'm just like the pictures that you take
I'm nothing but something that once was
Like colors that fade away in the sunlight
They're nothing special like they used to be
They're gone and they're never coming back
No, they're never coming back
I'm gone and I'm never coming back
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
I woke up today and realized that what we had is dead
I'm just a pile of lifeless bones to you
I've spent too many years thinking about somebody 
That doesn't even think about me
Thinking about somebody that doesn't even think about me
Thinking about somebody That doesn't even think about... 
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
Maybe this place is the same...
And we're just changing
Maybe this place is the same...
And we're just changing
I'm driving on state lines pretending you're standing there
But I know your feet will never be where my eyes fall again
Moving on is something I've always had trouble with
But this year I swear I'll get past it
If I had a backyard I would bury all my memories of you in it
Everything that we had would die right down in the dirt
I wish I had the guts to say this to your face
But the past five years took everything I had and ripped it out of me
You used to make me feel like I was something
Now you make me feel like absolutely nothing
I want to fall asleep and wake up four years ago
We were just kids who didn't know what love was
Or what we were digging ourselves into
I want to know if you ever hear 
All of these sad fucking songs I write about you
I wish I had the guts to say this to your face
But the past five years took everything I had and ripped it out of me
You used to make me feel like I was something
Now you make me feel like absolutely nothing
I know you probably hate who I've become
I'm just young and stupid, 
But that's the way I always want to be
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone 
You wouldn't know a good thing even if it slapped the makeup right off of your face
Burn down the bridges just in time for last call
Keep digging yourself neck deep into selfishness
I doubt that you'll ever find out who you really are
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone
Keep falling over that same fucking step on your front porch
Most people learn from their mistakes
But you'll just stay here tripping on the same mistakes
You always do
No one's knocked you off your feet, they say what you want to hear
You're living proof that we don't always get what we deserve
But you're really nothing special
Just another crack in the sidewalk
You never meant anything to me
Or anyone for more than one night
No one's gonna stick around for when you're broken down and blacked out
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone
Keep falling over that same fucking step on your front porch
Most people learn from their mistakes
But you'll just stay here tripping on the same mistakes
You always do
Throw away your early twenties giving up on everyone and everything around you
It never came so easy
Throw away your early twenties giving up on everyone and everything around you
It never came so easy
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone
Keep falling over that same fucking step on your front porch
Most people learn from their mistakes
But you'll just stay here tripping on the same mistakes
You always do
You used to make me feel like I could walk on water
Now most nights I'm just sinking down and down
You're the reason why I can't listen to the same songs I used to
I write songs about you all the time
I bet I don't run through your mind
I've given up on you, but it still hurts to know you're not alone
Don't worry, I'll keep out of your life and stay awake at night
It's 4am and you're keeping me from closing these sleepy eyes
Does the thought of me keep you up at night?
Like the light on the ceiling of your bedroom
Lately, my dog's the only one around that listens to my problems
It's been a lonely year 
I write songs about you all the time
I bet I don't run through your mind
I've given up on you, but it still hurts to know you're not alone
Don't worry, I'll keep out of your life and stay awake at night
With just my skin and bones
It hurts to know you're not alone
I've given up on you, and my skin, and my bones
Spit in my face, tell me I didn't mean what I said
I'll take those words with me when I'm dead
Open your mouth and contradict everything you said last summer
I don't even know you anymore, anymore
You really fucked me up this time for good, even though you didn't mean to
When the weather clears, that sweatshirt weather won't keep you warm like I do
You'll be thinking of my sleepy eyes and bony knees
You'll be thinking of me
Maybe I'll run away from home, fake my own death and see if you really care
A week goes by, I doubt you'll be waiting around for me at all
No matter how many times I walk up my driveway, you won't be there
You're nowhere to be found because everything you said was a lie
You really fucked me up this time for good, even though you didn't mean to
When the weather clears, that sweatshirt weather won't keep you warm like I do
You'll be thinking of my sleepy eyes and bony knees
You'll be thinking of me
You wanted me when I was running away
I needed you when I ripped your heart out
I can't count the times we fell apart
We can't go back, it's not the same
You really fucked me up this time for good, even though you didn't mean to
When the weather clears, that sweatshirt weather won't keep you warm like I do
You'll be thinking of my sleepy eyes and bony knees
You'll be thinking of me
When something's fallen apart as many times as us
I can't put it back together, it's not the same
This time around I wasn't honest enough with how I really felt
I'll spend the winter blending into the streets and sidewalks that make up this town
At least it gave me someone else to write another one of these sad fucking songs about
You're just another sad song to me
I've got this lonely night and Jimmy Eat World
I never had you and you told me I never did
The truth is you won't even be there when I can't stand on my own two feet
You won't be here
I saw right through you on my basement floor
But could you even see past my chest?
Could you ever feel past these hands?
Your intentions were only skin deep
Mine weren't honest enough to fall past my teeth
I've got this lonely night and Jimmy Eat World
I never had you and you told me I never did
The truth is you won't even be there when I can't stand on my own two feet
You won't be here
Will I ever know how it feels to be home again?
I've been told that home is where the heart is
If that's the case, I've never been home 
I've got this lonely night and Jimmy Eat World
I never had you and you told me I never did
The truth is you won't even be there when I can't stand on my own two feet
You won't be here
I've been up spending every late night in my car listening to all these sad songs
I know it sounds weird but they're helping me move past all these things running through my head
I'll blame the Midwest and sleepy eyes
I'm not where I should be
I'm not what I could be
But I'm not who I was
Nostalgia gets the best of me
When I wake up it's the same day
It fucks me up and makes me miss who I used to be
All I have are thoughts of me from back when I was eighteen and my bony knees
Don't want it to be like my teenage years
I was naive and weak back then without much trouble on my shoulders
If I don't break, I won't know how to put myself back together
Nostalgia gets the best of me
When I wake up it's the same day
It fucks me up and makes me miss who I used to be
All I have are thoughts of me from back when I was eighteen and my bony knees
If you never break, you'll never know how 
If you never break, you'll never know 
If you never break, you'll never know how to put yourself back together
Nostalgia gets the best of me
When I wake up it's the same day
It fucks me up and makes me miss who I used to be
All I have are thoughts of me from back when I was eighteen and my bony knees
Growing up is giving up
I'll sleep sideways on the bed in my moms basement 
It's where I feel at home
You'll sleep with regret and no heart left in your chest
I don't want to end up like you
Your eyes are set on what you'll never have
There's days I feel like a different person 
But I always come back to who I really am 
The American dream is dead, I'm still just a kid
Balancing on the sidewalks of this suburban town
Maybe this year I'll be able to stand up on my feet
Or maybe I'll fall again
I never want to grow out of this skin
That's been dragged through the dirt 
That's what made me find happiness 
My thumbs are broken but I'll take these broken thumbs 
Over your grip on an empty life
Your empty life
I've spent the end of my summer
Listening to these songs I know you don't like
I've been wondering where you are and who you're with
We used to lay on your kitchen floor at two a.m.
I was forty miles away from my house but I never felt so at home
I was forty miles away from my house 
You never called before you left to move west
I was just dead weight pulling you down
I'll move forward without the person I need
When somethings fallen apart as many times as us
I can't put it back together it's not the same
You still run through my head every night
When I lay in bed
You used to cover up the cigarette burn on the passenger seat
of my car
Now there's just empty coffee cups 
And long drives by myself
If you wore your personality on your skin, no one would take a second look
You were shallow when we met and you still are
The water won't be coming down anytime soon to change that
Loneliness keeps me warm at night and that's okay with me
I'd rather be alone in this bed made for two than listen to you and your judgement
Don't act like you're better than me
We're both fools lost in this cold world
You might not fall as much as I do, but if I look close enough I can find the scars on your knees
I can find the bags under your eyes that carry too much for you to handle
I'm starting to think that you're the reason why everyone left
So stop pointing your finger
You don't even really know me, not at all
You don't even really know me
Don't act like you're better than me
We're both fools lost in this cold world
You might not fall as much as I do, but if I look close enough I can find the scars on your knees
I can find the bags under your eyes that carry too much for you to handle
I said I'm selfish, I'm a liar and I'm broken
Shit runs through my head every day that I would never tell anyone
You're just like me
The only difference is that I'm honest enough to scream my flaws in the lines of this song
So much has changed back home since you left without packing all your things 
I always drive past your house hoping you'll be sitting on your porch
I still smell the smoke on your clothes 
And I can still hear those secondhand stories fall off your tongue
It's just not the same around here without you 
Most of the time I feel like you're in over your head out there 
You ran away from the Midwest and traded it in for beaches and east coast sunsets 
Don't take in too much too soon 
Keep your chin up out there 
Don't forget where you came from and who cares about you 
Whenever you're missing home, just look at your arm 
You've got the state lines inked into your forearm 
There's still memories of you pinned on my wall 
It's just not the same around here without you 
Most of the time I feel like you're in over your head out there 
You ran away from the Midwest and traded it in for beaches and east coast sunsets 
Don't take in too much too soon 
Maybe you'll be here next year to waste the fall away, watching the leaves blow across my driveway 
We could listen to American Football and talk about high school 
Just like we did the years before
Hope you're having fun away at college since you went there to run from all your fuck ups 
You're not so good at getting away from all of the karma that lies between your tongue and cheek 
It's gotten to the point that you're the spitting image of everything I never want to be 
I gave you chance after chance and it's obvious you haven't tried at all 
By now it's safe to say that I'll be erasing every trace you left in these lines 
I'm sorry for breaking down when I should've been stitching myself back up 
You left me on the fence with nowhere to jump since you always knew that my balance was as shitty as my judgment 
I had a feeling I'd be lying in the grass left for dead 
Now I'm stuck looking at that fence 
I gave you chance after chance and it's obvious you haven't tried at all 
By now it's safe to say that I'll be erasing every trace you left in these lines 
I'm sorry for breaking down when I should've been stitching myself back up
You've become the spitting image of everything I never want to be 
You're everything I never want to be
You'll spend every Saturday night on the bathroom floor with no recollection of the night before 
You're a train wreck and everything that's in between 
Being alone doesn't seem so bad to me 
You're the type of girl that lets this whole town know when your lips come anywhere near a bottle 
All you want is the attention from every eye and ear that covers up the walls in this room 
I'd rather sleep with just my bony knees and the thought of someone that stands up straight 
I guess I'll sleep alone tonight 
You'll tell everyone you're different, but you're just a shade of grey that never stuck out to anybody 
Fast forward to 2am and the walls aren't spinning around enough for you to forget your ex-boyfriend and all of your shitty friends 
You say you'll keep it together, but I know you're gonna make those walls fall down 
They always do 
I'd rather sleep with just my bony knees and the thought of someone that stands up straight 
I guess I'll sleep alone tonight 
You'll tell everyone you're different, but you're just a shade of grey that never stuck out to anybody 
I'd rather sleep with just my bony knees and the thought of someone that stands up straight 
I guess I'll sleep alone 
I'd rather sleep with just my bony knees and the thought of someone that stands up straight 
I guess I'll sleep alone tonight 
You'll tell everyone you're different, but you're just a shade of grey that never stuck out to anybody
I don't really think that I'm ready for another Chicago winter 
So you can stop making my bones feel cold 
I swear that emptiness lives inside your chest 
You're the reason you fell far away from what brought out your best 
Don't get me wrong, I wish a lot of things were the way they used to be 
The streets that used to make me feel alive just make me feel alone 
The holes in the wall get bigger every year 
It's hard to think that some people in this world look at me with the same eyes as yours 
I've been breaking all ten fingers for you and you wouldn't even lift one up for me 
Appreciation's something you lost in the dirt that's on your hands and knees 
But I'm never gonna be just a hole in the wall 
You can anchor down your feet and say fuck the past and everyone that dragged you here 
I'm not putting myself on a pedestal 
You need to stand up for yourself and who you claim you used to be 
It's hard to think that some people in this world look at me with the same eyes as yours 
I've been breaking all ten fingers for you and you wouldn't even lift one up for me 
Appreciation's something you lost in the dirt that's on your hands and knees 
Anchor down your feet, say fuck the past and everyone that dragged you here 
Just stand up for yourself and who you claim you used to be 
It's hard to think that some people in this world look at me with the same eyes as yours 
I've been breaking all ten fingers for you and you wouldn't even lift one up for me 
Appreciation's something you lost in the dirt that's on your hands and knees
You said I didn't cry out to the clouds for nothing 
You told me everything eventually works out 
That's what I'll keep telling myself 
I don't want to be jealous of the trees next to my neighbor's garage anymore 
I'll just lie in the mess I made 
Don't let me fall off the edge and break down 
Try not to forget everything I said 
Just another week and I'll pick myself up off my bony knees 
I guess it took a year to realize that what I had was everything I needed to feel okay 
But still I've got these sleepy eyes that have seen too much for me to handle 
I'm not gonna lie, my skin and bones have seen some better days 
Thirty pounds ago seems like a more stable place to stay 
I'm not gonna lie, my skin and bones have seen some better days 
I'm not gonna lie, my skin and bones have seen some better days 
Just another week and I'll pick myself up off my bony knees 
I guess it took a year to realize that what I had was everything I needed to feel okay 
But still I've got these sleepy eyes that have seen too much for me to handle 
There's no point to the floorboards in my house 
Nothing feels right 
I can't stand up without you 
Nothing feels right 
Just another week and I'll pick myself up off my bony knees 
I guess it took a year to realize that what I had was everything I needed to feel okay 
But still I've got these sleepy eyes that have seen too much for me to handle
We're just kids stuck in this town
Outside of a big city
Where everyone wants you to grow up as fast as they fall
My old friend Dave wakes up on Monday
Wishes there were more than two days in a weekend
I'll keep sleeping in on Monday not knowing
That my weekend is over
I'm just not ready to cut my hair and settle down
I'm not liking the thought of looking at myself
And seeing all the stress of my mother
And heavy eyes of my father
I don't have a lot of money
That's fine by me
I want to grow up in truck stops and on friends' floors
Maybe then I can feel my heart beat in rhythm with the real me
I wanted June to be in December since I felt summer on my shoulders
My old friend Dave wakes up on Monday
Wishes there were more than two days in a weekend
I'll keep sleeping in on Monday not knowing
That my weekend is over
I'm just not ready to cut my hair and settle down
I'm not liking the thought of looking at myself
And seeing all the stress of my mother
And heavy eyes of my father
We'll go run away
Waste all our time
We'll go run away
Waste all our time
We'll go run away
Waste all our time
We'll go run away
I'm just not ready to cut my hair and settle down
I'm not liking the thought of looking at myself
And seeing all the stress of my mother and heavy eyes
I'm just not ready to cut my hair and settle down
I'm not liking the thought of looking at myself
And seeing all the stress of my mother
And heavy eyes of my father
Now all my friends wake up on Monday
And wish that there were more than two days in a weekend
I'll keep sleeping in on Monday
Not knowing that my weekend is over
I won't forget when I couldn't go to bed with the lights off
When I heard that voice call me in for the night
I remember when love was just a word and not a fight
All I had to worry about were broken bones and being left alone
Way back then there were monsters in my closet
And now there's just skeletons hiding in there
The clock is ticking away
The leaves are still falling every day
The sunburn on my shoulders kept me warm back then
Like the heat from the blacktop again and again
I remember when smoke didn't fill my lungs
When my hands were lost and so young
It seemed like the houses were touching the sky
And I thought this smile on my face would never lie
Oh, the summer we were staring at the sun
The summer we were staring at the
Oh, the summer we were staring at the sun
Way back then there were monsters in my closet
And now there's just skeletons hiding in there
The clock is ticking away
The leaves are still falling every day
The sunburn on my shoulders kept me warm back then
Like the heat from the blacktop again and again
There are minutes when I want to leave this town
With the shirt on my back
And Saves the Day stuck in my head
But there's something keeping me here
I tell myself I won't go back
I'll never even look back
My friends are the only thing making me turn around
Keeping these sleepy eyes from staring at the ground
But I like it that way
They like it that way
I don't know where I'm going
I'm having one hell of a time getting there
Everyone's trying to find the meaning of the nights
We spent laughing forever
I don't know if we'll ever find it
I could sure as hell care less
The friends I've grown up with are still here
Kids I don't see anymore
Have left their hearts and minds in years behind
I look in my rearview mirror and think back
To the night at Denny's
When Mark and I laughed so hard we cried
I don't know where I'm going
I'm having one hell of a time getting there
Everyone's trying to find the meaning of the nights
We spent laughing forever
I don't know if we'll ever find it
I could sure as hell care less
I felt the still St. Louis nights
And the heat from the Las Vegas lights
I have seen the sun-beaten Texas skies
And cars from New York City passing by
But nothing's better than the wind running through my street
Through my street
One, two, three, four
I don't know where I'm going
I'm having one hell of a time getting there 
Everyone's trying to find the meaning of the nights
We spent laughing forever
I don't know if we'll ever find it
I could sure as hell care less
 

I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year.
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me.
If she told me who it was,
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see.
At least they'd know I had a heart.
If my name falls past your tongue and teeth, make sure it's in front of my eyes and not behind your cheap talk and eager lies.
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
The last thing I need is for words to sway past my ears through different voices than the person that first spit them out
The things you do and the people you talk to don't impress me or my friends in any way
Take the easy way out and fall over the cheap talk you send away
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing to prove
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes 
Sometimes the suburbs of that big city know how to fuck up my sleepy eyes just like you want to
I'm gonna keep getting up even when you keep trying to pull me down
If there's one thing that's not big enough for the both of us, it would be called this town
Stay away and stay out, I hope you never come back
Remember these words when you've got nothing
If you think this song's about you, don't worry it's not
I wouldn't waste my breath on you.
I listen back to the confines I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell
I heard the loft's reverb, all around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room and leaves me little choice
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
We'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching, it's almost working out
If you don't like the format you set the music to
You can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through
We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is
I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swing safely through the dark and carry on
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign
Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
Reassurance in the face of doubt
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
With what I said
I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds, while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent
I'm the candle when your lights burn out
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong to carry on
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
Can't put out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out
Now all of our trust is gone
You pull me like a ripcord
Ignored, you're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all of our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground, right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone, seem strong and carry on
I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
What are you running away from?
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
Not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me (my dreams laid out in front of me)
I've never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide only houses self doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Been avoiding conversation
But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
The walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out

But lately I'll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
The hand that used to feed
Now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast as time moves slow
You let me down but you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
I can never keep my mouth shut
But I can sure as hell keep my fingers crossed
My jaw's been hitting the sidewalk
Like branches in a storm
Your feelings eating up my driveway
It's a little too warm, a little too
Let's do this all night
All night
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
You and I will stand hand in young hand
Back then we'd have conversation
And not confrontation
We'd just open our mouths
And spit those bad words through our broken teeth
So let's do this all night
All night
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
I bet my last dollar
That me and you could never just talk
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice
So hey, let's talk it all out
This sounds a little too nice to
So hey, talk everything out
This sounds a little too nice to you
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep and its walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
You scare to take a chance on something real
It's been so long since you could feel
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
One thing I've learned is that
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
And though I gave my very best with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back
Woah woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
Woah woah
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
White knuckles and sleepy eyes
That's how you and I grew up, that's how we grew apart
You've got some big expectations hiding in that small mid-western town that you call home
It's been twenty something years and I've never been home
I don't even know who the hell I am anymore
I'm really just a kid who's stuck with all the fucked up stuff that comes with life
There's nights I think about how there's someone else that feels how I do
It helps to think I'm not alone.
Let's sail away
Find our own country
We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees
Let's get away
Let's push our lives aside
I'll sport a smile
Take in some color
Under the stars
I'll be your lover
With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
Let's go to bed
Let's stop debating
Look at the time
We're always waiting
But we're in love
And that should be just fine
When it seems like things are only getting better
When it seems like we can never catch a break
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
And if you like (and if you like)
And if you like some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive (if we survive)
If we survive, get out alive
I'd like to say how beautiful I think you...
Just a keep a hold on me don't let go
If you float away if you float away
Waiting too long for a ship to come
Don't you float away, don't you float away
I walk on this frozen lake, 
Hoping to hit a spot that's weaker than I was,
A year a half ago. 
I remember how Christmas used to be,
Before she spat me out.
And left me to roam this empty place.
If I ran to the city sub lights, I'd still feel dull and worn out.
It's time to start over and move on.
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says "you can't miss what you forget."
I'll spend the night slamming doors,
Smoking outside my grandparents house.
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved.
I feel like no one understands me anymore.
Nothing is how it was last year.
But it's cold and lonely, just like before.

"Unconditional Love" is Kyle Fasel's favorite song on the album, but it nearly didn't make the cut. he states. 
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want
Knock me down
I'm not sure I have it in me to get back up
To be who I am seems exhausting anyway
You have a lot in common with my conscience
You both erase my confidence
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Back and forth
Between some kind of vague attachment to yesterday
And never knowing what form of myself I'll get today (to get today)
I'll always be a faded sign in your eyes
No matter what the point of view (point of view)
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
I'm not here
You only hear what you want
You only hear what you want to hear
I can't leave you
You can't leave me
We've been stuck in here forever
If I disappear, if I disappear
I can't see you, you can't see me
We'll be lost in here together
If I disappear would you notice I'm not here
Would you notice I'm not here
Am I telling myself the truth?
I'm used to pretending to be strong and clueless
Am I doing this right by you?
I seem to be coming off as wrong and ruthless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I changing my mind again?
All this indecision makes me shift my focus
Is the tension my only friend?
Anxiety holds my hand when life gets hopeless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Am I telling myself the truth about my self-esteem
And how others place their worth in me?
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
(The eyes of someone else)
So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom
Yeah, I'll keep smiling on the surface
(Am I telling myself the truth?)
"Smiling On The Surface" is the 3rd song released from the album "Composure". It was premiered on June 18, 2018.
Swallowing a feeling
Counting cracks across the ceiling
Never reached the depths of them before
Finding flaws in every format
I know but haven't shown that
I could pick myself up off the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Redefine rock bottom with these empty orange bottles
Never felt so paralysed before (never felt this paralysed)
We're all looking for some answers
With the hangman's broken lantern
Growing ever closer to the floor
I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
Why do I, why do I, feel so damn cold?
Why am I, why am I, still so low?
Why should I, why should I, get up or get out?
Why should I?
From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
Soft spoken, if ever out loud
These days not much gets out
My mind digs graves through the past
But never takes time to finish the act
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
No matter how cold it might get
My bed sheets are laced with regret
I try to fill in the lines
Rework the plans for a better design
Can I shoulder the burden?
Can I stomach the past?
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Here I am, bearing every burden
Here I am, showing every worry
To the world
To the world
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a flame in the pouring rain
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try to stand steady
Like a bird in a hurricane
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Looking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown
Watch me try
I'm at best your second option
Like a key under the mat
Are my emotions hard to read?
Seems I'm good at hiding
Reality
You disregard the consequences
Always seem to shift the blame
You burn the bridge and then I build it
Seems you're good at hiding
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
You make me feel helpless
Like a bird with broken wings
Forcing me to be more selfless
Lean on me, don't knock me over
It seems we're good at hiding
It seems we're good at fighting
Reality
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
I'm all alone
I feel sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
I'm all alone
I'm feeling sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
(There's nothing I can do)
Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
Is there any chance you could cut me some slack?
Because I've been hanging for a while
From this withered rope
Forcing every sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
What could I ask that you help me hold back
Cause I've been falling for a while
Down this fucking slope
Losing any sense I had of hope
Have you ever felt the last spark of innocence die
Before your very eyes and fade out of your life?
I keep asking myself
"What wood was I carved from?"
But is it worth it for me to ask
Which branch fell and left me here
To crawl through this sinkhole?
There's a collage of photos framed
Dating '93 to '95
Though all it shows me is that
I'm just a bad seed
Falling off the family tree
I've got more complaints
More than pleasantries to say
Every monument is idly arranged
Every figure that has ever held importance in my life
I find nobody is who I pictured them to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the faces in reflections of the past
I feel so close but I can't reach through the glass
My life burns out and flickers like the end of a cigarette
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
My hands are numb because it's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I see the light in your eyes
Turn the blind eye (Turn the blind eye)
"Why are you hurting me" she screamed from her death bed
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
Look at me, I'm trying to say
I haven't been slipping away
I'm nothing like they pictured me to be
It's getting colder quicker
You need more warmth than I provide
If only my skin were thicker
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
I feel it eat my insides, I'm paralyzed with guilt
If only your skin were thinner
I wouldn't feel the need to hide
The tears run down your cheekbones
I feel sorry for you
But I'm too fucking selfish to say I do
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be different
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Today I ripped myself wide open
And I saw that my heart isn't as fucked as I recalled
It's still flawed and
It's sorely stitched to my old ways
I thought it was buried, but it's just stuck
To my old ways
I'm a rain cloud
And the sun is shining right through me
I'm trying to be something else
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
Shaking in the driver's seat
Staring at the dashboard
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
I'm holding myself back
While you're trying to break me open
Please just stay
Please just stay
You see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key
You look at me and see an open window
That let you in
I see myself as this locking door
Without a key to take a chance on me
To take a chance on me
To take a chance
I still see us sitting on that old couch
'Til the sun comes up
Listening to sad songs
We spent our time with smiles on our faces
I know it sounds selfish but I'll miss those days
I know it sounds selfish
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
The Fall leaves flying through the driveway
Keep triggering these memories of you
I'm torn apart with how our lives are changing
I'm sure it sounds selfish, I'm just being honest
I know it sounds selfish
But I'm trying to be honest
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
Let's go back to when thing weren't complicated
Let's go back to all those old dashboard songs
Let's go back to smoking on the side of my old house
We can never go back, we'll never go back
We'll never go back
Honestly, as time goes on
Change becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall that blocks my mind
I know it sounds selfish
I'm just being honest
I can't fix everything around me
I can't make everybody happy
And it'll be okay
Show me how to be something other than nostalgic
I want to feel inspired and innocent again
I just want to be worth your time
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Lately when I'm alone I keep thinking about the past
I'm trying to feel weak in my knees again
I want to stand up straight like when I graduated
I just want to be
Just let me be worth your time
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
Do you remember when you saw right through my selfish skin?
Do you remember when I ignored everything you did?
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Too much time spent overthinking
Yeah, I've spent too much time
Feeling like I should be sinking
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
(And it's okay)
I can't fix everything around me
(And it's okay)
I can't make everybody happy
It'll be okay
We rush through our lives
Just to feel some kind of pride
Dismissing actualities is making matters worse
The ink will fade, but won't go away
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
I live in the middle of a lake
And I don't know how to swim
I've isolated everything
Everywhere I go I am consistently alone
A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in
You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this
Cautions only ever made me worry
You know that cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
You're best to get your things and leave
Because cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
The patience I once had is running away with my youth
Away in its hands
I've been neglecting who I am
That's just who I was back then
Don't need to be perfect, just happy
I'm still a lost boy
I'm still a lost boy
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
Every once in a while I listen to Death Cab and think about how it used to be 
We thought that we knew the answers
When no one was asking
Asking the questions 
I'm still a lost boy 
I'm still a lost boy 
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
It feels like I've been taking the long way for a while now
Haven't been at home in more years than I care to say
I keep letting my past cover what the present shouldn't be
What I shouldn't be
Last year I was a trainwreck, now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
Staring out the window in my bedroom makes me think back
I see me as a boy out there
Lying in the grass
Singing songs with all the wrong notes
And graduating high school as my mom cries
I'm writing the same song over and over again
And feeling lost
I've always felt so lost
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I clenched the wheel the whole way home from Cleveland
With nothing more than my eyes half way open
And my hand smelling like smoke
Each mile I drive gets me closer to the streets that made me feel alone
I'm out of place and it doesn't feel wrong
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm fucking up and getting over it
I'm over it
I'm over it
I used to get half way home and give up on getting there
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I'll stumble over my own feet
Thinking about everyone and everything that got past me
I care too much
While you don't even care at all
It's just sad that you don't even care
I walk up the stairs to your apartment and I feel small
The lowest feelings and even lower standards
Pictures of simple times are on the top shelf
You lie to me and say you're happy with the way things are
With the way things are
It's just sad, oh it's sad that you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I spent so much damn time trying to move forward
It hurts me to watch you falling backwards
Brave your life
Finding solutions, not making excuses
Find solutions and stop waiting for excuses
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
I care too much, while you don't even care at all
A bit much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
I want to carry you but I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different
Don't settle because you're scared
You know I pictured things to be different
I pictured things to be different for you
For you
Could you stay here 'til I fall asleep?
We'll pretend that we could make each other feel complete
I'm looking for something that's not inside of you
Will you think of me when you drive home?
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
Last night I closed my eyes
And thought about someone that wasn't you
The weight of the world slipped off my shoulders
And weighed my back to the floor
It isn't where you want to be
I know this isn't where you want to be
I think I'm better off when I'm alone
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
You tell me I'm broken
As I stare out my window at the street lights
I walk outside and I sit in the shade at 3am
And I feel whole again
Let's keep lying next to each other
While we lie to ourselves
We say that this feels right
Our hipbones touch
And I know we're disconnected
And I know we're disconnected
I'm getting pretty good at leaving, my patience isn't wearing thin
Autumn never ends in my head, no matter how far I've been
It feels like everybody is the branch and I'm the leaves
Falling from the top of every leafless tree
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
All I see is the past two years before I hit the ground
Time is moving slower on the way down (on the way down)
Save your time spent wondering what's going through my mind
Let me go before you see me following behind
I'll save you from myself
Just let me go
I'll save you from myself
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
I've learned that it's okay to be selfish
It keeps me from falling apart at the seams
Stuck is where I feel in place
A feeling I'll embrace
The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
So much for bad luck
If I built a boat with apologies I've got
I'd have a sorry looking raft
It always rains
But it's nice to see
That someone else is sad
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
The coin's faced up
But I'm not feeling any better
A soap box made for every single fuck up
It's tough seeing where I am
Instead of where I'm from
My roots can get loose
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
Can you find your calling if nothing is calling for you?
I'm coughing up a lung trying to get rid of you
To get rid of you
To get rid of you
Can you find your calling
If nothing's calling for you?
For you?
I'm tired, oh I'm tired of being a scapegoat
For your bad days
Or when it rains
'Cause lately I've been hoping that my mind finds an anchor
So I can stay in one place
When I heard my parents cry
I realized that we're all lost kids
Trying to find our way home
Blood is thicker than water
And I still feel like everyone I love forgot how to swim
At least there are pictures of my sister and me
Hanging on the wall in my garage
They always give me peace of mind
They always give me peace of mind
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I'm starting to see that
We're always changing
It's just so weird to think that we're always changing
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
I never spent my youth thinking of half the shit I'd go through
Living in the past never helped me
Last night I drove past the house that I grew up in
And tried to find that happiness
Living in the past never helped me
Or anyone move forward
There's no love, no growth for me here
Anymore, anymore
I still love you mom and dad
But I feel more at home when I'm away from here
I'll never find anything in this dead place
My heart's been buried in the midwest
And I've been digging out for the past three years
For the past three years
Maybe this place is the same and we're just changing
I know this place is the same and that I'm changing
And I'm just
When I get stopped by a train on my drive home
I don't let it get to me like the rest of the world
I smile and think about how much I've grown over this year
It gives me time to open my mind and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that train
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine without you
I've laid to rest the shit that was always out of my hands
I finally sent all my skeletons away
Like everything I couldn't fix and people I couldn't change
Konstantine always tore me apart and made me cry
Now I hear that song and know that...
I'm moving forward just like that train
I'm moving forward just like that...
On its own happiness won't get me over anything
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I'm doing just fine without you
I hope that I'm fine
Happiness, won't get me over this
Happiness, won't get me over anything, over anything 
Being broken opens my eyes, wide enough to see
I spend my nights thinking the worst
And telling myself that everything's going to work out
I keep kicking myself in the mouth
Opening up every cut that should be a scar by now
I need the hope I always tell my friends about
I need the hope I always tell my friends about
I sleep with the TV on, it covers up my feelings about the past
Here I am lying awake thinking about how things used to be
I'm sick and tired
I'm sick and tired of being at the same old place in my head
Give me peace of mind
I always backtrack to my old self
When I'm holding on to despair and cracks in my life
I'm holding on when I need to let go
I sleep with the TV on, it covers up my feelings about the past
Here I am lying awake thinking about how things used to be
Doubt is the soil that fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
Doubt is the soil that fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
Doubt is the story of how fear grows in
I'm dirty from head to toe
I'm dirty from head to toe
I'm dirty from head to toe
Change holds me down to the places I don't want to be
When I wake up I look in the mirror and I see
The person that's been scaring me away from moving on
And getting out of my head
I end my nights in the same spot that I told myself I would leave
I want to come home and have it be like it was before I left
I'm starting to see that I keep living alone in the past
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
I can't shake it off
Always a fight between my past,
My head, and my heart, you can cut me up
And spread me all over Illinois
I can't, I can't find myself
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
I'm stuck and I feel like I'm the only one
I end my nights in the same spot that I told myself I would leave
I want to come home and have it be like it was before I left
I'm starting to see that I keep living alone in the past
Since loneliness will never leave my mind
Did I get left behind?
Or is everybody else just hiding that they're lost
Loneliness will never leave my mind
Loneliness will never leave my mind
Did I get left behind?
Or is everybody else just hiding that they're lost
Just when I think I need someone, 
They wrap their arms around my old bones 
And I start breaking apart
I walk away from anyone that cares about me
But I swear my skin's not as rough as I make it out to be
The saddest part is I've been distant since I was sixteen
It keeps me up in bed
I'm stuck here with all the choices I've made 
And the chances I was too afraid to take
I've called myself young and stupid, 
But lately I feel old and desperate
I find it kind of weird how you find yourself 
When you have no one
I look for the right things in all the wrong places
The saddest part is I've been distant since I was sixteen
It keeps me up in bed
I'm stuck here with all the choices I've made 
And the chances I was too afraid to take
I found myself in a late night drives
Without a destination
All I had were thoughts about the past
And a list of my favorite songs to keep me company
But I still struggle and lose myself everyday
I always find myself lost in every line of all these songs
But I felt better when I saw that this is life
And in life were gonna cry
In life were gonna lose sleep
Were gonna feel helpless
But thats how its got to be 
When you lose yourself you'll find what you're looking for
I'm growing past who I used to be
As the night goes on 
I go from feeling out of place to feeling like a ghost
You miss me when I'm gone
But when I'm around it's like I'm hidden behind the paint on the walls
The loneliness will keep me warm tonight
It'll keep me warm seeing as you won't
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more than this
If the open road is my home I'm never leaving
All of the small towns make me throw away my biggest fears
And the big cities make the fucked up stuff feel smaller
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more than this
When I'm not here does anyone miss my secondhand smoke?
Do you wonder where I am or who I'm with?
Call me a mid-twenty sob story
I can't change the way I feel
I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend 
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more,
Looking for something more
You were easy on my eyes
You were heavy on my heart
I never thought I'd live to see today
You're still in my mind
But not in my chest
I'm a little worn out since you fucking tore me down
You made me believe we had something
I guess that I was wrong
I thought I would be numb to this by now
I guess I was wrong
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
Stick with me or don't stick around at all
I was the boy who was too scared and ran away
I was the glue that never dried
You were the girl that made up her mind
And left me all alone to die
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
I'll sit on my basement floor
Turn off all the lights and try to not think about you
Just know that when I'm down there
I'll know that I won't be running through your mind
You were easy on my eyes
You were heavy on my heart
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
And I'll get through the winter without you
You made me believe we had something
Well I guess that I was wrong
I'm treated like an old book
That was left on the shelf
Everyone underlined what they wanted to read
And forgot the rest
My spine was left worn out and bent
So just take what you want from me
And forget the rest
It really weirds me out 
Because I never thought I'd be where I am today
My bones want to tear out of my skin
This isn't where I want to be
Getting older scares the shit out of me
I'm an old book
It's one of those nights where I'm scared to walk to my basement
These four walls, feel like they're caving in
There's pictures of you and me hidden behind my couch
I'll be waiting for the sun to shine through my window well
Am I trying to forget you or just cover you up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
I used to have an escape
But I ripped the map up a long time ago
So I'll lie to myself and say that I don't care at all
You'll always be hidden in the basement of everything I love
Am I trying to forget you or just cover you up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
The only time that I feel fine
Is when I'm parked in front of my house with tears in my eyes
I find comfort in weakness because it's always there for me
You'll always be hidden in the basement
Of everything I love
Are you trying to forget me or did you cover me up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
I can't believe you've got the nerve to say you love me
Then you left me for dead
I don't love you anymore
I hope you're happy since I don't know you anymore
You were a part of me 
And now you're just nothing but a memory
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
Now I'm just like the pictures that you take
I'm nothing but something that once was
Like colors that fade away in the sunlight
They're nothing special like they used to be
They're gone and they're never coming back
No, they're never coming back
I'm gone and I'm never coming back
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
I woke up today and realized that what we had is dead
I'm just a pile of lifeless bones to you
I've spent too many years thinking about somebody 
That doesn't even think about me
Thinking about somebody that doesn't even think about me
Thinking about somebody That doesn't even think about... 
No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed 
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
Maybe this place is the same...
And we're just changing
Maybe this place is the same...
And we're just changing
I'm driving on state lines pretending you're standing there
But I know your feet will never be where my eyes fall again
Moving on is something I've always had trouble with
But this year I swear I'll get past it
If I had a backyard I would bury all my memories of you in it
Everything that we had would die right down in the dirt
I wish I had the guts to say this to your face
But the past five years took everything I had and ripped it out of me
You used to make me feel like I was something
Now you make me feel like absolutely nothing
I want to fall asleep and wake up four years ago
We were just kids who didn't know what love was
Or what we were digging ourselves into
I want to know if you ever hear 
All of these sad fucking songs I write about you
I wish I had the guts to say this to your face
But the past five years took everything I had and ripped it out of me
You used to make me feel like I was something
Now you make me feel like absolutely nothing
I know you probably hate who I've become
I'm just young and stupid, 
But that's the way I always want to be
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
Forever a lost boy with bony knees
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone 
You wouldn't know a good thing even if it slapped the makeup right off of your face
Burn down the bridges just in time for last call
Keep digging yourself neck deep into selfishness
I doubt that you'll ever find out who you really are
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone
Keep falling over that same fucking step on your front porch
Most people learn from their mistakes
But you'll just stay here tripping on the same mistakes
You always do
No one's knocked you off your feet, they say what you want to hear
You're living proof that we don't always get what we deserve
But you're really nothing special
Just another crack in the sidewalk
You never meant anything to me
Or anyone for more than one night
No one's gonna stick around for when you're broken down and blacked out
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone
Keep falling over that same fucking step on your front porch
Most people learn from their mistakes
But you'll just stay here tripping on the same mistakes
You always do
Throw away your early twenties giving up on everyone and everything around you
It never came so easy
Throw away your early twenties giving up on everyone and everything around you
It never came so easy
When we grow up I hope that you end up old and all alone
Keep falling over that same fucking step on your front porch
Most people learn from their mistakes
But you'll just stay here tripping on the same mistakes
You always do
You used to make me feel like I could walk on water
Now most nights I'm just sinking down and down
You're the reason why I can't listen to the same songs I used to
I write songs about you all the time
I bet I don't run through your mind
I've given up on you, but it still hurts to know you're not alone
Don't worry, I'll keep out of your life and stay awake at night
It's 4am and you're keeping me from closing these sleepy eyes
Does the thought of me keep you up at night?
Like the light on the ceiling of your bedroom
Lately, my dog's the only one around that listens to my problems
It's been a lonely year 
I write songs about you all the time
I bet I don't run through your mind
I've given up on you, but it still hurts to know you're not alone
Don't worry, I'll keep out of your life and stay awake at night
With just my skin and bones
It hurts to know you're not alone
I've given up on you, and my skin, and my bones
Spit in my face, tell me I didn't mean what I said
I'll take those words with me when I'm dead
Open your mouth and contradict everything you said last summer
I don't even know you anymore, anymore
You really fucked me up this time for good, even though you didn't mean to
When the weather clears, that sweatshirt weather won't keep you warm like I do
You'll be thinking of my sleepy eyes and bony knees
You'll be thinking of me
Maybe I'll run away from home, fake my own death and see if you really care
A week goes by, I doubt you'll be waiting around for me at all
No matter how many times I walk up my driveway, you won't be there
You're nowhere to be found because everything you said was a lie
You really fucked me up this time for good, even though you didn't mean to
When the weather clears, that sweatshirt weather won't keep you warm like I do
You'll be thinking of my sleepy eyes and bony knees
You'll be thinking of me
You wanted me when I was running away
I needed you when I ripped your heart out
I can't count the times we fell apart
We can't go back, it's not the same
You really fucked me up this time for good, even though you didn't mean to
When the weather clears, that sweatshirt weather won't keep you warm like I do
You'll be thinking of my sleepy eyes and bony knees
You'll be thinking of me
When something's fallen apart as many times as us
I can't put it back together, it's not the same
This time around I wasn't honest enough with how I really felt
I'll spend the winter blending into the streets and sidewalks that make up this town
At least it gave me someone else to write another one of these sad fucking songs about
You're just another sad song to me
I've got this lonely night and Jimmy Eat World
I never had you and you told me I never did
The truth is you won't even be there when I can't stand on my own two feet
You won't be here
I saw right through you on my basement floor
But could you even see past my chest?
Could you ever feel past these hands?
Your intentions were only skin deep
Mine weren't honest enough to fall past my teeth
I've got this lonely night and Jimmy Eat World
I never had you and you told me I never did
The truth is you won't even be there when I can't stand on my own two feet
You won't be here
Will I ever know how it feels to be home again?
I've been told that home is where the heart is
If that's the case, I've never been home 
I've got this lonely night and Jimmy Eat World
I never had you and you told me I never did
The truth is you won't even be there when I can't stand on my own two feet
You won't be here
I've been up spending every late night in my car listening to all these sad songs
I know it sounds weird but they're helping me move past all these things running through my head
I'll blame the Midwest and sleepy eyes
I'm not where I should be
I'm not what I could be
But I'm not who I was
Nostalgia gets the best of me
When I wake up it's the same day
It fucks me up and makes me miss who I used to be
All I have are thoughts of me from back when I was eighteen and my bony knees
Don't want it to be like my teenage years
I was naive and weak back then without much trouble on my shoulders
If I don't break, I won't know how to put myself back together
Nostalgia gets the best of me
When I wake up it's the same day
It fucks me up and makes me miss who I used to be
All I have are thoughts of me from back when I was eighteen and my bony knees
If you never break, you'll never know how 
If you never break, you'll never know 
If you never break, you'll never know how to put yourself back together
Nostalgia gets the best of me
When I wake up it's the same day
It fucks me up and makes me miss who I used to be
All I have are thoughts of me from back when I was eighteen and my bony knees
Growing up is giving up
I'll sleep sideways on the bed in my moms basement 
It's where I feel at home
You'll sleep with regret and no heart left in your chest
I don't want to end up like you
Your eyes are set on what you'll never have
There's days I feel like a different person 
But I always come back to who I really am 
The American dream is dead, I'm still just a kid
Balancing on the sidewalks of this suburban town
Maybe this year I'll be able to stand up on my feet
Or maybe I'll fall again
I never want to grow out of this skin
That's been dragged through the dirt 
That's what made me find happiness 
My thumbs are broken but I'll take these broken thumbs 
Over your grip on an empty life
Your empty life
I've spent the end of my summer
Listening to these songs I know you don't like
I've been wondering where you are and who you're with
We used to lay on your kitchen floor at two a.m.
I was forty miles away from my house but I never felt so at home
I was forty miles away from my house 
You never called before you left to move west
I was just dead weight pulling you down
I'll move forward without the person I need
When somethings fallen apart as many times as us
I can't put it back together it's not the same
You still run through my head every night
When I lay in bed
You used to cover up the cigarette burn on the passenger seat
of my car
Now there's just empty coffee cups 
And long drives by myself
If you wore your personality on your skin, no one would take a second look
You were shallow when we met and you still are
The water won't be coming down anytime soon to change that
Loneliness keeps me warm at night and that's okay with me
I'd rather be alone in this bed made for two than listen to you and your judgement
Don't act like you're better than me
We're both fools lost in this cold world
You might not fall as much as I do, but if I look close enough I can find the scars on your knees
I can find the bags under your eyes that carry too much for you to handle
I'm starting to think that you're the reason why everyone left
So stop pointing your finger
You don't even really know me, not at all
You don't even really know me
Don't act like you're better than me
We're both fools lost in this cold world
You might not fall as much as I do, but if I look close enough I can find the scars on your knees
I can find the bags under your eyes that carry too much for you to handle
I said I'm selfish, I'm a liar and I'm broken
Shit runs through my head every day that I would never tell anyone
You're just like me
The only difference is that I'm honest enough to scream my flaws in the lines of this song
So much has changed back home since you left without packing all your things 
I always drive past your house hoping you'll be sitting on your porch
I still smell the smoke on your clothes 
And I can still hear those secondhand stories fall off your tongue
It's just not the same around here without you 
Most of the time I feel like you're in over your head out there 
You ran away from the Midwest and traded it in for beaches and east coast sunsets 
Don't take in too much too soon 
Keep your chin up out there 
Don't forget where you came from and who cares about you 
Whenever you're missing home, just look at your arm 
You've got the state lines inked into your forearm 
There's still memories of you pinned on my wall 
It's just not the same around here without you 
Most of the time I feel like you're in over your head out there 
You ran away from the Midwest and traded it in for beaches and east coast sunsets 
Don't take in too much too soon 
Maybe you'll be here next year to waste the fall away, watching the leaves blow across my driveway 
We could listen to American Football and talk about high school 
Just like we did the years before
Hope you're having fun away at college since you went there to run from all your fuck ups 
You're not so good at getting away from all of the karma that lies between your tongue and cheek 
It's gotten to the point that you're the spitting image of everything I never want to be 
I gave you chance after chance and it's obvious you haven't tried at all 
By now it's safe to say that I'll be erasing every trace you left in these lines 
I'm sorry for breaking down when I should've been stitching myself back up 
You left me on the fence with nowhere to jump since you always knew that my balance was as shitty as my judgment 
I had a feeling I'd be lying in the grass left for dead 
Now I'm stuck looking at that fence 
I gave you chance after chance and it's obvious you haven't tried at all 
By now it's safe to say that I'll be erasing every trace you left in these lines 
I'm sorry for breaking down when I should've been stitching myself back up
You've become the spitting image of everything I never want to be 
You're everything I never want to be
You'll spend every Saturday night on the bathroom floor with no recollection of the night before 
You're a train wreck and everything that's in between 
Being alone doesn't seem so bad to me 
You're the type of girl that lets this whole town know when your lips come anywhere near a bottle 
All you want is the attention from every eye and ear that covers up the walls in this room 
I'd rather sleep with just my bony knees and the thought of someone that stands up straight 
I guess I'll sleep alone tonight 
You'll tell everyone you're different, but you're just a shade of grey that never stuck out to anybody 
Fast forward to 2am and the walls aren't spinning around enough for you to forget your ex-boyfriend and all of your shitty friends 
You say you'll keep it together, but I know you're gonna make those walls fall down 
They always do 
I'd rather sleep with just my bony knees and the thought of someone that stands up straight 
I guess I'll sleep alone tonight 
You'll tell everyone you're different, but you're just a shade of grey that never stuck out to anybody 
I'd rather sleep with just my bony knees and the thought of someone that stands up straight 
I guess I'll sleep alone 
I'd rather sleep with just my bony knees and the thought of someone that stands up straight 
I guess I'll sleep alone tonight 
You'll tell everyone you're different, but you're just a shade of grey that never stuck out to anybody
I don't really think that I'm ready for another Chicago winter 
So you can stop making my bones feel cold 
I swear that emptiness lives inside your chest 
You're the reason you fell far away from what brought out your best 
Don't get me wrong, I wish a lot of things were the way they used to be 
The streets that used to make me feel alive just make me feel alone 
The holes in the wall get bigger every year 
It's hard to think that some people in this world look at me with the same eyes as yours 
I've been breaking all ten fingers for you and you wouldn't even lift one up for me 
Appreciation's something you lost in the dirt that's on your hands and knees 
But I'm never gonna be just a hole in the wall 
You can anchor down your feet and say fuck the past and everyone that dragged you here 
I'm not putting myself on a pedestal 
You need to stand up for yourself and who you claim you used to be 
It's hard to think that some people in this world look at me with the same eyes as yours 
I've been breaking all ten fingers for you and you wouldn't even lift one up for me 
Appreciation's something you lost in the dirt that's on your hands and knees 
Anchor down your feet, say fuck the past and everyone that dragged you here 
Just stand up for yourself and who you claim you used to be 
It's hard to think that some people in this world look at me with the same eyes as yours 
I've been breaking all ten fingers for you and you wouldn't even lift one up for me 
Appreciation's something you lost in the dirt that's on your hands and knees
You said I didn't cry out to the clouds for nothing 
You told me everything eventually works out 
That's what I'll keep telling myself 
I don't want to be jealous of the trees next to my neighbor's garage anymore 
I'll just lie in the mess I made 
Don't let me fall off the edge and break down 
Try not to forget everything I said 
Just another week and I'll pick myself up off my bony knees 
I guess it took a year to realize that what I had was everything I needed to feel okay 
But still I've got these sleepy eyes that have seen too much for me to handle 
I'm not gonna lie, my skin and bones have seen some better days 
Thirty pounds ago seems like a more stable place to stay 
I'm not gonna lie, my skin and bones have seen some better days 
I'm not gonna lie, my skin and bones have seen some better days 
Just another week and I'll pick myself up off my bony knees 
I guess it took a year to realize that what I had was everything I needed to feel okay 
But still I've got these sleepy eyes that have seen too much for me to handle 
There's no point to the floorboards in my house 
Nothing feels right 
I can't stand up without you 
Nothing feels right 
Just another week and I'll pick myself up off my bony knees 
I guess it took a year to realize that what I had was everything I needed to feel okay 
But still I've got these sleepy eyes that have seen too much for me to handle
We're just kids stuck in this town
Outside of a big city
Where everyone wants you to grow up as fast as they fall
My old friend Dave wakes up on Monday
Wishes there were more than two days in a weekend
I'll keep sleeping in on Monday not knowing
That my weekend is over
I'm just not ready to cut my hair and settle down
I'm not liking the thought of looking at myself
And seeing all the stress of my mother
And heavy eyes of my father
I don't have a lot of money
That's fine by me
I want to grow up in truck stops and on friends' floors
Maybe then I can feel my heart beat in rhythm with the real me
I wanted June to be in December since I felt summer on my shoulders
My old friend Dave wakes up on Monday
Wishes there were more than two days in a weekend
I'll keep sleeping in on Monday not knowing
That my weekend is over
I'm just not ready to cut my hair and settle down
I'm not liking the thought of looking at myself
And seeing all the stress of my mother
And heavy eyes of my father
We'll go run away
Waste all our time
We'll go run away
Waste all our time
We'll go run away
Waste all our time
We'll go run away
I'm just not ready to cut my hair and settle down
I'm not liking the thought of looking at myself
And seeing all the stress of my mother and heavy eyes
I'm just not ready to cut my hair and settle down
I'm not liking the thought of looking at myself
And seeing all the stress of my mother
And heavy eyes of my father
Now all my friends wake up on Monday
And wish that there were more than two days in a weekend
I'll keep sleeping in on Monday
Not knowing that my weekend is over
I won't forget when I couldn't go to bed with the lights off
When I heard that voice call me in for the night
I remember when love was just a word and not a fight
All I had to worry about were broken bones and being left alone
Way back then there were monsters in my closet
And now there's just skeletons hiding in there
The clock is ticking away
The leaves are still falling every day
The sunburn on my shoulders kept me warm back then
Like the heat from the blacktop again and again
I remember when smoke didn't fill my lungs
When my hands were lost and so young
It seemed like the houses were touching the sky
And I thought this smile on my face would never lie
Oh, the summer we were staring at the sun
The summer we were staring at the
Oh, the summer we were staring at the sun
Way back then there were monsters in my closet
And now there's just skeletons hiding in there
The clock is ticking away
The leaves are still falling every day
The sunburn on my shoulders kept me warm back then
Like the heat from the blacktop again and again
There are minutes when I want to leave this town
With the shirt on my back
And Saves the Day stuck in my head
But there's something keeping me here
I tell myself I won't go back
I'll never even look back
My friends are the only thing making me turn around
Keeping these sleepy eyes from staring at the ground
But I like it that way
They like it that way
I don't know where I'm going
I'm having one hell of a time getting there
Everyone's trying to find the meaning of the nights
We spent laughing forever
I don't know if we'll ever find it
I could sure as hell care less
The friends I've grown up with are still here
Kids I don't see anymore
Have left their hearts and minds in years behind
I look in my rearview mirror and think back
To the night at Denny's
When Mark and I laughed so hard we cried
I don't know where I'm going
I'm having one hell of a time getting there
Everyone's trying to find the meaning of the nights
We spent laughing forever
I don't know if we'll ever find it
I could sure as hell care less
I felt the still St. Louis nights
And the heat from the Las Vegas lights
I have seen the sun-beaten Texas skies
And cars from New York City passing by
But nothing's better than the wind running through my street
Through my street
One, two, three, four
I don't know where I'm going
I'm having one hell of a time getting there 
Everyone's trying to find the meaning of the nights
We spent laughing forever
I don't know if we'll ever find it
I could sure as hell care less
You're still indulgent enough
To quench a thirst that drowns most right out
Oh, there's a drought, you know
You're losing all of your interest now
I'm standing up on my feet and off my bruised knees
Far away from your high hopes to please
I'm getting up, I'm getting up
I hope to God it's bringing you down
You've been lying to me while I lie two in by myself
Oh, I know you really know how to fuck up
My sleepy eyes and crooked back
I still don't know how I got this way
You can't explain how I got this way
I still don't know how I got this way
We don't know
I'm standing up on my feet and off my bruised knees
Far away from your high hopes to please
I'm getting up, I'm getting up
I hope to God it's bringing you
I'm standing up on my feet and off my bruised knees
Far away from your high hopes to please
I'm getting up, I'm getting up
I hope to God it's bringing you down
I hope to God it's bringing you down
I hope to God it's bringing you
I'm standing up on my feet and off my bruised knees
Far away from your high hopes to please
I'm getting up, I'm getting up
I hope to God it's bringing you down
